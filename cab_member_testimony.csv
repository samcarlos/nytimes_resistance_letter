Name,TextKelly_John,"Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member McCaskill, and distinguished Senators of the Committee,please accept my thanks and appreciation for considering my nomination to lead the men andwomen of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Senator McCain, Senator Carper, and Secretary Gates – I am grateful that each of you took thetime to be here on my behalf, and for your kind words.Please allow me to introduce my family. My wife, Karen, is here, as are my daughter and son-inlaw.Anyone who has answered the call to serve our country knows that the personal sacrifices ofpublic service are often felt most acutely by their families. As the wife and mother to threestrong-willed Marines and one determined FBI agent, Karen has been my anchor and I’mgrateful for her love and partnership.Over the past 45 years, I have been privileged to serve my nation as both an enlisted Marine andan officer. I have led platoons and divisions. I have held senior command positions in Iraq,served as the Combatant Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, and as the Senior MilitaryAssistant to two Secretaries of Defense—Secretaries Gates and Panetta. I have worked with ourallies, across agencies, the private sector, and with independent experts to identify innovative,comprehensive solutions to current and emerging threats.These assignments—while varied—shared the common characteristics of working within andleading large, complex, and diverse mission-focused organizations, while under great pressure toproduce results.I am humbled to once again be called to serve, this time with the men and women of theDepartment of Homeland Security.As I solemnly swore before God when I entered the Marine Corps, if confirmed, I will faithfullysupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign anddomestic—every second of every day.I believe in America and the principles upon which our country and way of life are guaranteed. Ibelieve in respect, tolerance, and diversity of opinion. I have a profound respect for the rule oflaw and will always strive to uphold it. I have never had a problem speaking truth to power, and Ifirmly believe that those in power deserve full candor and my honest assessment andrecommendations.I love my country, and I will do everything within my power to preserve our liberty, enforce ourlaws, and protect our citizens. I recognize the many challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security—and should I be confirmed—I look forward to partnering with you all toprotect the homeland.I look forward to discussing the future of this Department and answering the Committee’squestions. Thank you for this opportunity. "Robert Lighthizer,"This is an historic day for the United States. Today, for the first time, we will start negotiating to revise a major free trade agreement.  American politicians have been promising to renegotiate NAFTA for years, but today President Trump is going to fulfill those promises.I want to thank members of Congress, and their staffs, who have helped lay the groundwork for these negotiations.  We look forward to working with them now and in the future as things proceed.I would also like to thank the members of our advisory committees, and other stakeholders, who have given USTR their thoughts about how this agreement can be improved.  We held three days of hearings, and we received testimony and comments from thousands of stakeholders.  Their suggestions are critical to our process, and we appreciate everyone’s help.First, I know we all agree that NAFTA needs updating. This is a 23 year-old agreement and our economies are very different than they were in the 1990’s. We need to modernize or create provisions which protect digital trade and services trade, e-commerce, update customs procedures, protect intellectual property, improve energy provisions, enhance transparency rules, and promote science-based agricultural trade.In each of these areas, hopefully we will develop model provisions that can be used for years ahead and that have the flexibility to adapt to future innovations that we can’t even imagine at this point. This is an important part of our process.After modernizing, the tough work begins. We must balance the legitimate interests of literally millions of people in our countries -- those of farmers, and businesses, and workers and yes, families.Many Americans have benefited from NAFTA. For many of our farmers and ranchers, Canada and Mexico are their largest export markets. Americans send billions of dollars of corn and soybeans, and poultry across our borders to dinner tables throughout North America.These are hardworking people with families who ask little from their government. Many are particularly vulnerable today because of low commodity prices.I’ve always thought that communities along our borders have a particular equity in this agreement. In many cases their lives, businesses, and families are very much on both sides of the dividing line. They too are hardworking men and women trying to raise a families and accumulate wealth. We must keep their interests paramount.But for countless Americans, this agreement has failed.We cannot ignore the huge trade deficits, the lost manufacturing jobs, the businesses that have closed or moved because of incentives -- intended or not -- in the current agreement.The numbers are clear. The U.S. Government has certified that at least 700,000 Americans have lost their jobs due to changing trade flows resulting from NAFTA. Many people believe that number is much, much bigger than that. In 1993, when NAFTA was approved, the United States and Mexico experienced relatively balanced trade. However since then, we have had persistent trade deficits – in the last year totaling nearly $57 billion. In the auto sector alone, the U.S. has a $68 billion deficit with Mexico.  Thousands of American factory workers have lost their jobs because of these provisions. In recent years, we have seen some improvement in our trade balance with Canada.  But over the last ten years, our deficit in goods has exceeded $365 billion. The views of the President about NAFTA, which I completely share, are well known.  I want to be clear that he is not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions and a couple of updated chapters.  We feel that NAFTA has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement.Here are some of the examples of what I believe needs to be changed. We need to assure that huge trade deficits do not continue and that we have balance and reciprocity.  This should be periodically reviewed. Rules of origin, particularly on autos and auto parts, must require higher NAFTA content and substantial U.S. content. Country of origin should be verified, not “deemed.” Labor provisions should be included in the agreement and be as strong as possible. The agreement should have effective provisions to guard against currency manipulation. The dispute settlement provisions should be designed to respect our national sovereignty and our democratic processes. We should include provisions to guard against market-distorting practices of other countries, including third-party dumping and state-owned enterprises. We should assure that there is equal access and reciprocity in government procurement and agriculture.These are just a few examples of key priorities for the United States – but I think they are sufficient to show that our task is a very difficult one.  On the other hand, the stakes are high for all of our citizens and the benefits of a good agreement can be substantial.My hope is that together we will produce a result which moves us to freer markets, fairer and balanced trade, and stronger ties between our three countries.  I look forward to working with Secretary Guajardo and Minister Freeland on this very important effort. Thank you very much, and now we will get down to work."Robert L. Wilki,"Mr. Chairman, Senator Tester and distinguished members of the Committee onVeterans Affairs. This is the third time I have appeared in the confirmation chair.Just as in 2006 and 2017, my wife Julie is with me. We have known each othersince we were youngsters in North Carolina. Our high school was two blocks fromthe Veterans Hospital in Fayetteville. On our way to and from school we could nothelp but read the sign at the entrance –“The price of freedom is visible here”.I am humbled today not only by the confidence placed in me by the President andthe support of our Veterans Service Organizations, but to be introduced by SenatorTillis. No one better exemplifies what those of us who have come through themilitary world strive to be—a servant leader.I have been privileged to experience military life from many angles, as the son of agravely wounded combat soldier; as an officer; as a senior leader in the Pentagon,including leading the Defense Health Agency reform, and eight weeks as ActingSecretary of Veterans Affairs.My modest military service was inspired by my ancestors. I walked the field ofShiloh with my great grandfather, Colonel Abram Somerville. As a young captainof field artillery, he saw thousands perish in minutes in the Meuse Argonne in1918. In the short time that I was privileged to know him, he impressed upon methe cost paid by ordinary Americans caught up in the incommunicable experienceof war.Mr. Chairman my own life changed when my father returned from his secondcombat tour in Vietnam. I was seven when we received a message that he hadbeen terribly wounded. When he came home after a year in military hospitals, heweighed less than half of what he did when he left us. I watched his agonizingrecovery and that experience was on my mind when I was asked to come to VA.2As Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs, I visited five VA hospitals across thecountry—met with the combined leadership of our three major VA components—Benefits, Health and Cemeteries—and visited our Claims Processing center inBaltimore and the Maryland Veterans Treatment Court presided over by mychildhood friend, Judge Halee Weinstein.It is clear that the Veterans population is changing faster than we realize. For thefirst time in forty years—half of our veterans are under the age of sixty-five. OfAmerica’s twenty million veterans, ten percent are now women. The newgeneration is computer savvy and demands 21st century service—service that isquick, diverse and close to home. For the VA to thrive as an integrated health carenetwork, it must be agile and adaptive.More importantly, I experienced what can never be duplicated in the privatesector—the communal aspect of VA. What does that mean? It means that whenour veterans walk into any of VA facility they converse with men and women whospeak the unique language of military service.What are the priorities?• Improve the culture—offer world class customer service• Improve access to care through implementation of the MISSION Act andtransformative IT Modernization such as the Electronic Health RecordsProgram.• Reduce the backlog of claims and payments.• Business transformation including reform of the human resource systemsMr. Chairman, the prime directive is customer service. When an American veterancomes to VA it is not up to him to employ a team of lawyers to get VA to say YES.It is up to VA to get the Veteran to YES—that is customer service.Many of the issues I encountered as Acting Secretary were not with the quality ofmedical care but with getting our veterans through the door to reach that care.Those problems are administrative and bureaucratic. Alexander Hamilton said,“The true test of a good government, is its aptitude and tendency to produce a goodadministration.” That is where VA must go.The new Electronic Health Record system is the first step to modernize ourappointment system, it is also the template to get us started on the road to automatedisability claims and our payment claims particularly to our providers in rural 3America and those who administer emergency care. More importantly, theinteroperability of the new electronic health records system will connect VA to theDOD, private doctors and private pharmacies to create a continuum of care andorganize the healthcare around our veteran’s needs. This is also our opportunity toturn the corner and be an industry leader on opioid abuse intervention and suicideprevention.Business transformation to standardize our policies and procedures across theVISNs is also essential if we are to move past the mid-1990s compartmentalizedmodel and give power to the professionals closest to our veterans. This meansreforming human resource systems to give those same people more leeway tomanage their budgets and recruit, retain and relocate the staff they need to serveveterans.Transformation also means entering into more robust partnerships with our stateand local communities to address Veteran homelessness, that particularly plaguesour Vietnam Veterans who also suffer the highest rates of suicide.We are also pledged to help veterans transition to a new life in education and nonmilitarycareers. If confirmed, I will leverage VA’s strong partnership with Labor,Defense, and other agencies to carry out this pledge.Mr. Chairman, as Secretary Mattis said when this Congress passed a $700 billionDefense budget, there are no more excuses. You have infused VA with a $200billion budget, you have passed the Accountability Act—to shake up complacency--and you have passed the Mission Act to bring the institutional VA, communitycare and caregivers closer together. The future is up to the Department. Ifconfirmed, I pledge to help build on your work.I would like to close with a charge from President Eisenhower.Five months after his inauguration, about forty Korean War Veterans climbedaboard the yacht Williamsburg—many were missing limbs, some were horriblydisfigured. When Ike arrived at the pier, the Secret Service ran up the plank toseparate the President from his troops. Seeing that, Eisenhower yelled “Halt! Iknow these men”. The agents retreated, and the soldiers gathered around thePresident. He addressed them at attention and said there was nothing the countrycould do for them to compensate for what they had given to America but, he said,“You never put away your uniform. You must get well, to remind yourcountrymen every day that freedom is never free”. Mr. Chairman that is why VA must succeed--to remind Americans every day thatfreedom is not free. "mnuchin,"Thank you very much. Chairman Hatch, RankingMember Wyden, and members of the committee, it is an honor toappear before you today. I am grateful and humbled by PresidentelectTrump nominating me to serve as Secretary of the Treasury.It is truly an honor and a privilege to be considered for this position.Thank you to all the members I have already had an opportunityto meet with during this process. I enjoyed meeting with you andlearning more about the issues that are important to you. For thosefew members whom I did not get a chance to meet with, if confirmed,I look forward to meeting with you as well.I would like to thank Chairman Hatch and his staff for takingso much time to work with me and support me through this process.In addition, I would like to introduce my fiance´, Louise Linton,and my children, Emma, J.P., and Dylan, who are here with metoday, and thank them for their unwavering support.I would also like to introduce my brother, Alan Mnuchin, and hiswife, Alessandra, and my father, Robert Mnuchin, who has alwayssupported me and taught me that hard work, determination, andthe ability to bring people together can make anything possible.I would like to acknowledge my late mother, Elaine Terner Cooper,who was an inspiration to me. I would also like to acknowledgemy grandparents, Emanuel and Mathilda Terner, who were also atremendous influence in my life.My grandfather was a first-generation American whose fatheremigrated from Europe. He truly embodied the American dream.He started out blowing glass bottles by hand and later built MidlandGlass into one of the largest glass manufacturing companiesin the United States, with five factories employing thousands ofworkers. My first job ever was in his factory when I was in highschool. It was there that I first learned the importance of humility,hard work, and commitment.For those of you who do not know my background, I studied economicsat Yale University. At the age of 22, after graduating fromYale, I got a job at Goldman Sachs, where I spent the next 17years. I started on a folding chair in the mortgage department.  Nine years later, after many sleepless nights, I was put in chargeof mortgages, U.S. Government bonds, and municipal securities.Several years after that, I worked directly for future Secretary ofthe Treasury Hank Paulson as the firm’s chief information officer.In that role, I oversaw 5,000 people and a $1-billion budget.While at Goldman Sachs, I learned the importance of the financialmarkets in providing liquidity and capital to businesses, governments,and consumers. A few years later, I decided to leaveGoldman Sachs to build an investment business. After workingbriefly at ESL Investments, I started my own investment business,Dune Capital Management.Throughout my career, my commitment was to my clients andshareholders, for whom I worked tirelessly to get the best results.Thirty years later, my commitment is now to the American people,for whom I will work tirelessly by helping to grow our economy andcreate jobs.I am eager to share with you why I believe I will serve well asAmerica’s next Secretary of the Treasury. But first I want to correctthe record about my involvement with IndyMac Bank.Since I was first nominated to serve as Treasury Secretary, Ihave been maligned for taking advantage of others’ hardship inorder to earn a buck. Nothing could be further than the truth.During the summer of 2008, I saw the devastation that wascaused by the housing crisis when I watched people line up to gettheir life savings out of IndyMac Bank. It was the middle of thefinancial crisis and, despite the global panic, I saw a way to savethe bank. I applied for a banking charter and submitted a bid tothe FDIC for IndyMac. On December 31st, just before midnight, wesigned a binding agreement with the FDIC. They later confirmedthat our bid was almost $1 billion higher than the next best bid.We were willing to invest $1.6 billion into the most costly bankfailure ever to the FDIC deposit fund. We did this because we believedin our ability to rebuild and create a successful regionalbank. We believed in recovery for the American economy.Let me be clear: my group had nothing to do with the creationof the risky loans in the IndyMac loan portfolios. When we boughtthe bank, we assumed these bad loans, which had been originatedby previous management. Some of those individuals had to answerto Federal authorities for their bad lending decisions.We invested $1.6 billion into a failing financial institution whenmost investors were running for the hills. We renamed the businessOneWest Bank and saved thousands of jobs. We developed aprospering community banking franchise in southern California asmost banks were pulling back. Over the next 2 years, we boughttwo more struggling banks from the FDIC: First Federal of SantaMonica and LaJolla Bank, both through competitive bidding. Combined,we had over 70 branches and built a robust lending business,especially for small and medium-sized businesses.As chairman of the bank, I met with hundreds of business peoplefrom all walks of life who were seeking loans to grow their businessesand prosper. Like many banks at the time, IndyMac, andits reverse mortgage division, Financial Freedom, was unstable dueto the large amount of distressed credit mortgages in its portfolios.When we bought IndyMac, these ‘‘legacy loans’’ were included in the purchase. The responsibility landed on me to clean up the messothers made that we inherited.We worked very hard to help homeowners remain in their homesthrough modifications, wherever possible. Ultimately, OneWest extendedover 100,000 loan modifications to delinquent borrowers totry to help them out of a bad situation.I am proud of the fact that loan modifications started at IndyMacunder the leadership of the FDIC. However, the FDIC loan modificationprogram did not work for everyone. When the FDIC tookover IndyMac, they estimated that more than half the foreclosureswould not meet their test for a loan modification. And they demandedmany policy conditions: extend assistance to sympatheticborrowers by establishing affordable and sustainable payments byborrowers, increase the net present value of cash flows to theowner of the loan, and stabilize housing markets. My group had toadhere to servicing agreements that limited our ability to makeloan modifications that could have helped more borrowers.In the press it has been said that I ran a ‘‘foreclosure machine.’’This is not an accurate description of my role at OneWest Bank.On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended tostop foreclosures. I ran a ‘‘loan modification machine.’’ When wecould do loan modifications, we did them, but many times theFDIC, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and bank trustees imposed strictrules governing the process of these loans.I am proud to be able to say that our bank was able to do over100,000 loans modifications that allowed people the opportunity tostay in their homes. Unfortunately, not all of the homes were ableto be saved through these programs, and despite my best efforts,some were sadly subject to foreclosure.So sincere was my concern over this that in 2010 I instructed mylawyers to sue HSBC, as trustee of the securitized loans, to allowus to do loan modifications on loans in mortgage trusts theyoversaw. We won on summary judgment and were consequently allowedto do more loan modifications and keep more Americans intheir homes.Similarly, in 2015, when HUD issued Mortgagee Letter 2015–11,I wrote HUD and asked them to change the policy so we did nothave to foreclose on senior citizens who were behind small amountsof money on taxes and insurance. I was so troubled by this that Idiscussed it with our primary regulator, the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency. Unfortunately, HUD did not agree, and wewere forced to foreclose on senior citizens, even if they only owed$1. Not complying with these HUD policies would have subjectedthe bank to penalties and losses from HUD.Despite our inability to save every home from foreclosure, I amproud of the fact that OneWest Bank was the only one of 14 banksthat was able to complete the independent foreclosure review thatwas conducted by the OCC. Every one of the 175,000 borrowerswho were in the foreclosure process during 2009 and 2010 wereable to have an independent review of their loan. We had a verylow error rate, and independent government reviews routinelyshowed that we had the most effective loan modifications of anybank. If we had not bought IndyMac Bank, the bank would likely havebeen broken up and sold in pieces to private investors, where theoutcome for consumers could have been much more bleak. Overall,I helped many homeowners stay in their homes and escape financialruin through my management of OneWest Bank.My experience confirmed that we must identify and eliminateunwise and burdensome policies which contributed to the disastrousoutcomes that came in the wake of the financial collapse.Many Americans are still suffering from the disastrous ripple effectsthe 2008 crisis had on our Nation. Faithfully ensuring thisdoes not happen again means supporting careful oversight of a financialsystem which prioritizes the needs of everyday Americansover the wishes of financial institutions or the Federal Government.I felt great empathy for the millions of hardworking Americanfamilies who lost their homes because the system failed them. Ifconfirmed as Treasury Secretary, I will work diligently and compassionatelyfor the American people so that we never endure anythinglike the meltdown of 2008 ever again.I was deeply honored when Donald Trump asked me to join hiscampaign as Finance Chairman. I had the opportunity to travelwith him and hear firsthand from hardworking Americans abouttheir concerns for the American economy. Over the last year, I visitedover 50 cities in 26 States.I remember attending my first rally with him in Indianapolis. Itwas an unforgettable experience. As we arrived into the stadiumpacked with 20,000 people, I saw the excitement that people hadfor a Trump presidency.On our trip to Flint, MI, I went with the President-elect to visitthe water treatment facilities and saw firsthand the crumblingpipes and the devastation caused by that lead-tainted water. Wemet with water engineers and saw the impact it had on that communityand the families that live there.Across the country on my travels with the President-elect, weheard the pained and heartbreaking stories of Americans who hadlost their jobs to workers in foreign countries. We heard the concernsof people and small businesses burdened by high taxes justtrying to make ends meet.In my meetings with you over the last month, you have sharedthe concerns of your constituents, like farmers who worry about thedeath tax wiping out the family farms, or workers who are nervousabout whether their retirement accounts will be safe from ruin.One of the greatest reasons I was drawn to President-electTrump’s campaign was that it was predicated on a commitment tostimulating prosperity for Americans of all backgrounds, whetherthey live in the inner city of Detroit, rural North Carolina, the coalcountry of Ohio or West Virginia, or any place in between.I share the President-elect’s goal to economically empower everycitizen. We will not rest in our mission until that is a reality.Among the President-elect’s signature issues in this campaignwas reviving trade policies that put the American worker first. Iwill enforce trade policies that keep our currency strong on theworld exchanges and create and protect American jobs. We will also make America the best place for companies to dobusiness. Sensible regulation is a necessity for healthy markets.However, I saw firsthand how regulatory excess can inhibit lendingby financial institutions, resulting in a lack of access to capital forsmall businesses and entrepreneurs.Alexander Hamilton remarked that the wealth of a nation maybe promoted by, quote, ‘‘multiplying the objects of enterprise.’’Hamilton knew the unique value of entrepreneurial activity to athriving economy. From our Nation’s earliest days, American businesseshave been the greatest repository of ingenuity and entrepreneurialspirit in the world. We need to unleash that power to generatejobs and create abundance for Americans of all backgrounds.We will work diligently to limit regulations, lower taxes on hardworkingAmericans and small businesses, and get the engine ofeconomic growth firing on all cylinders again.In this age of unprecedented online attacks, we must also be vigilantabout cybersecurity. If confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury,I will use my expertise in technology to protect Americans’ informationat the IRS and keep our financial architecture safe from maliciousattacks.I will use the Treasury Department’s Office of Terrorism and FinancialIntelligence to stop the financing of terrorism. I will partnerwith other government agencies in our shared goal of allowingour financial markets to operate free from digital and physicalthreats.If I am confirmed as Treasury Secretary, I promise I will workhard with this committee, all members of Congress, and the administrationto put forth policies that will help American familiesreach and maintain prosperity. We will make America great again.Thank you, and I look forward to answering your questions. "elaine chao,"Mr. Chairman, I want to take a minute to express my condolences to the friends and lovedones of the victims of Friday’s horrific shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood InternationalAirport.I also want to thank the heroic work that was undertaken by first responders and lawenforcement personnel in responding to this shooting.Although the investigation remains ongoing, I expect all of us here in Congress to continueexploring ways to protect the traveling public in light of this tragic incident. While we madesome progress in last year’s FAA bill to double the number of K-9 teams and bolster thescreening of airport workers, this shooting serves as reminder that our work to improve airportsecurity remains a constant challenge and is far from complete. This year’s FAAreauthorization bill could be a good place to start if more needs to be done to prevent similartragedies from occurring.Mr. Chairman, we are here today at a time when our nation is at a crossroads.Many of our roads, bridges, tunnels and rails are aging and desperately need to be repaired orreplaced.Years of neglect and increased demand have brought us to a point where we can no longer sit idly by and watch our country’s most critical infrastructure continue to deteriorate.We must step up to the challenge. We must commit to build the next generation of greatAmerican infrastructure or risk harming our economy and global competitiveness by failing todo so.That means investing in projects that will move people and goods for decades to come, sucha• Ports – like those in my state of Florida that are responsible for moving goods in andout of our country• Rails and highways that move those goods throughout our states• Transit and rail projects that get Americans to work• Airports and passenger rail projects that connect our communities, and• Technologies of tomorrow that will move people and goods more efficiently and moresafely.These projects will also create good paying jobs – whether it’s the construction worker layingthe foundation for a new project, an engineer doing the design work, or the steel workermaking the parts.The benefits of updating and expanding our transportation infrastructure can producethunderous ripple effects – creating new developments, generating increased investments,and driving new economic opportunities.This is what our country needs now and for the future. But it takes a strong commitment fromCongress and the administration, and it will take a significant amount of funding.Secretary Chao, I hope we’ll hear more from you today on the incoming administration’s planand how you intend to pay for it.Our nation’s transportation challenges include more than deteriorating roads and bridges.Safety continues to be a serious problem across all of our transportation sectors.The last two years marked a continuing and disturbing trend of rising fatalities on ourhighways, reversing the significant progress we’ve seen over a half century.The department must aggressively use all of its authority and resources to bring thesenumbers down, whether its cracking down on drunk and distracted driving, increasing seatbeltuse, or getting defective vehicles – such as those with exploding Takata airbags – fixedimmediately.And the department must also prepare for the future. As I speak, automakers are rapidlymoving toward commercializing autonomous technology and self-driving cars. The departmentmust play a central role in ensuring that this technology is truly safe for the American public.Aviation safety is also critical.An important task before the committee this year is FAA reauthorization, which is currently setto expire on September 30, 2017.Chairman Thune and I worked hard on a bipartisan and comprehensive FAA reauthorizationbill last year, which passed the Senate by 95 to 3. Unfortunately, our reauthorization bill stalled in the House given a proposal there to privatizeAir Traffic Control (ATC) services.Besides being costly and disruptive in implementation, such a privatization scheme wouldupset the partnership between the FAA and the Department of Defense, which provides 15 to20 percent of ATC services in this country.Last, but certainly not least Secretary Chao, I hope we’ll get a commitment from you that you’lllook out for the traveling public by ensuring they have basic consumer protections. Thismeans working with us in Congress to make sure that airline passengers know what they arepaying for upfront and that these costs are fair. These provisions had broad bipartisansupport in last year’s FAA reauthorization bill, and we should get them across the finish linethis year.I look forward to hearing from you, especially about your plans to invest in our country’s futureand ensure a safe transportation system for all."mike pomeo,"Senator Dole, thank you for your kind words. But more importantly, thank you for the greatservice you have performed for Kansas and for America both in your life as an elected official,as a soldier in WWII and as a patriot who worked so hard to build the memorial to honor thosewho fought in that war. Every Kansan—and I think it’s safe to say, all of your former colleagueshere in the Senate—know that they have benefitted from your wit, your patriotism and yourkindness. I know that I have.Senator Roberts, thank you too for your kind introduction. I am especially grateful for yourguidance over the years, not simply because you are the Dean of our Kansas Congressionaldelegation, but due to your insights as the former Chairman of this committee. As Chairman,you provided critical leadership during a pivotal and challenging period of American history –during the early years of the Global War on Terrorism and the Iraq War – and I hope I cancontinue to count on your advice and counsel.Chairman Burr, Vice-Chairman Warner, Senators – I thank you for the opportunity to appearbefore you today as the nominee for the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 2Should I be fortunate enough to be confirmed by the Senate, I hope to visit you more often fromLangley than I have from across the Capitol. I mean this not as a criticism of relations betweenthe two Houses of Congress, but a recognition of how much value I would place on relationsbetween the CIA and its Congressional overseers.I want to thank the members and staff of this Committee for their attention to my nominationover the last few weeks. Since I first joined the House Permanent Select Committee onIntelligence (HPSCI) in the 112th Congress, I have felt a special appreciation for the hard workthat goes into Congressional oversight. The tremendous honor we have in overseeing theintelligence community is only tempered by the sobering burden of grappling in secret with themany national security challenges facing our country.I would like to thank President-elect Trump for nominating me to serve in this role and for thefaith he has shown in me. It is an honor to be selected as the next steward of the premierintelligence agency that is the CIA. I look forward to working with Senator Dan Coats, nomineefor the Director of National Intelligence, and supporting him in his critical role, if we are bothconfirmed.I want to thank my patient and patriotic wife Susan, and my son Nicholas, each whom I lovedearly. They are both supporting me here this morning. The two of you have been so selfless inallowing me to return to public service— first as a member of Congress and, now, if confirmed,back working with warriors who keep America safe. I cannot tell you how much it means tohave you sitting with me today.3I am also grateful to the people of the 4th Congressional District of Kansas, who have entrustedme to represent them in the House of Representatives since 2011. I am proud to have earned andkept their trust, and have cherished every minute of service to my constituents.That said, having been a Member of the House Intelligence Committee and an overseer of ournation’s intelligence enterprise, I understand full well that my job, if confirmed, will be tochange roles from policymaker to information provider. My job will be to stay clearly on theside of intelligence collection and objective analysis of our national security challenges—presenting factual intelligence and sound judgments to policymakers, including this Committee.I have spent the majority of my life outside the realm of politics – as a cavalry officer in theUnited States Army, then as a litigator, and then running two manufacturing businesses.Returning to duty requiring hard work and unerring candor is something that is in my bones.***Today, I would like to first briefly sketch some of the specific challenges facing the U.S.;second, address trends in intelligence I have seen from my post on HPSCI; and finally, describewhat I see as the CIA’s role in addressing these challenges.Threat EnvironmentFirst, as many have noted, this is the most complicated threat environment the U.S. has faced inrecent memory. The litany is now familiar:_ As Director Clapper acknowledged at the beginning of 2016: “there are now more Sunniviolent extremist groups, members, and safe havens than at any time in history.”4_ ISIS remains a resilient movement, has metastasized, and shockingly has controlled majorurban centers in the Middle East for well over two years. Whereas a few years ago, wefocused on stemming the flow of foreign fighters going to Syria and Iraq, today, the concernis making sure they, and those they inspire, are prevented from expanding their reach,returning home, or slaughtering more innocent people._ Syria is a failed state and has become one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes of the 21stcentury. This conflict has led to the rise of extremism, sectarianism, instability in the regionand Europe, and the worst refugee crisis the world has faced in recent memory._ Iran – the leading state sponsor of terror – has become an emboldened, disruptive player inthe Middle East, fueling tension with our Sunni allies._ Russia has reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threateningEurope, and doing nearly nothing to aid in t5Intelligence TrendsIntelligence is vital to every national security issue facing the United States. As some have said,it is the “lifeblood” of national security and is more in demand than ever._ Intelligence enables better-informed decisions by reducing uncertainty; it is critical inseeking to avoid strategic or tactical surprise, and to giving our armed forces superior domainawareness._ We rely on intelligence from around the globe to keep danger from our shores. High qualityprecision intelligence enables our military efforts._ More and more, intelligence is critical to making effective other elements of national powerincluding sanctions against weapons proliferators, cyber criminals, perpetrators of warcrimes, and terrorist financiers._ We share capabilities and intelligence to improve relationships in furtherance of our nationalsecurity objectives. Foreign governments and liaison services are vital partners in preventingattacks and providing crucial intelligence. It is important that we thank our foreign partnersfor standing with us.As we face a deteriorating global picture, the U.S. needs to redouble its efforts by ensuring wehave more intelligence, not less. Indeed, senior Intelligence Community leaders worry thatrecent budget cuts will have a silent, corrosive effect—weakening the fabric of the intelligencecommunity. If confirmed, as Director, I intend to be an advocate for a strong and vibrantintelligence community and for CIA’s centrality in that community. 6There are at least five long term trends making the urgency of recognizing and supportingintelligence critically important._ First, the Intelligence Community finds itself a potential victim of a longer term negativebudgetary trend. Given the vital role of intelligence in national security, and given theincreasing threats we face, this makes little sense._ Second, technological advancement across the globe, even by non-hostile countries, ischallenging the U.S. advantage, as commercial technologies spread into the hands of thosewho wish us harm. The world is gaining on the U.S._ We have long seen this dynamic with the proliferation of chemical and biological weaponsand ballistic missile technology, but increasingly in the cyber domain, countries thought to beunsophisticated, such as North Korea, have overcome what appear to be low technologicalbarriers of entry to engage in offensive cyber operations. The U.S. must continue to investwisely to maintain a decisive advantage._ The effects of dislocation, lack of governance, and the rise of non-state actors threaten ournational security and present critical challenges to the Intelligence Community. This iscreating new targets for CIA’s intelligence collection and analysis that compete for attentionwith the usual state suspects and bad actors._ Finally, the insider threat problem has grown exponentially in the digital age.Counterintelligence is a perennial issue and we must be increasingly aware that those withinour agencies have access to millions of files. By the same token, the use of digital assets byforeign actors creates intelligence opportunities. 7CIA’s RoleI want to talk in more detail about today’s challenges. The greatest threats to our nationalsecurity have always been the CIA’s top priorities. And the CIA has always been at the forefrontof America’s comprehensive efforts to meet these threats. Since September 11, 2001, the CIA’sactivities have been extraordinary. As the tip of the spear in the war on terrorism, the CIA hasput tremendous pressure on our enemies, reducing their freedom to plan, communicate andtravel.The CIA has always played integral roles in America’s fight against radical Islamic terror. Itsounded warning bells before 9/11 of al Qaeda’s growing global reach. CIA officers were thefirst into Afghanistan to lay the groundwork for the military effort that struck a major blow to alQaeda and drove the Taliban from power. From understanding and tearing apart al Qaeda in Iraqnetworks, to the hunt for bin Laden, the CIA has been at the forefront of the fight every step ofthe way.My outline above of hard targets and challenges merely skims the surface of the potential threatsfacing the United States. If confirmed, it will be the CIA’s mission to bring other pressingproblems, risks, and challenges from regions and countries that don’t always make the front pageto the attention of senior policymakers. Indeed, if we are doing our job, we will help U.S.policymakers act early to prevent such problems from becoming front page news._ It will also be the CIA’s mission, and my own, to ensure the Agency remains the best in theworld at its core mission: discovering the truth and searching out information. In this 8complex threat environment, we must gather intelligence from the most elusive targets and inthe most difficult environments. We will need to rely on liaison services and newrelationships, which are critical to gathering information around the world. Even so, U.S.intelligence must continue to expand its global coverage to keep up with these threats. Whileintelligence sharing relationships with our friends and allies are important, they cannotreplace our own unilateral recruiting and operations. To protect America, the CIA mustcontinue to be the world’s premier espionage service._ One obvious emerging area for increased focus – both unilaterally and in conjunction withour partners – is the cyber domain. The internet – and the connectivity of our world,systems, and devices – is a borderless, global environment, easily and frequently exploited bysophisticated adversaries like China and Russia, as well as by less sophisticated adversarieslike Iran and North Korea, non-state actors, terrorist groups, criminal organizations, andhackers. While NSA and Cyber Command play leading roles, cyber has become critical tovirtually every intelligence operation and CIA must continue to operate at the forefront onthis issue._ As the President-elect has made clear, one of my top priorities, if confirmed, is to assist indefeating ISIS. Radical Islamic terrorism is both a symptom and a catalyst of the terribleconflicts raging in the Middle East that have created both a humanitarian and strategiccatastrophe. The enduring capability of al Qaeda and its affiliates, the rise and resilience ofISIS and Islamic extremists in Libya and across the Middle East, and the brutality of alShabaab and Boko Haram, should remind us of the need to maintain an aggressivecounterterrorism posture. It is also critical to address what manifestations of this threat andideology emerge – beyond ISIS and al Qaeda.9_ We must also be rigorously fair and objective in assessing the Joint Comprehensive Plan ofAction. As the deal permits domestic enrichment and other nuclear research anddevelopment, U.S. policymakers will need increased intelligence collection and insightfulanalysis. While as a Member of Congress I opposed the Iran deal, if confirmed, my role willchange. It will be to drive the Agency to aggressively pursue collection operations andensure analysts have the time, political space, and resources to make objective andmethodologically sound judgments. If confirmed, I will present their judgments topolicymakers._ The same goes for Russia. It is a policy decision as to what to do with Russia, but Iunderstand it will be essential that the Agency provide policymakers with accurateintelligence and clear-eyed analysis of Russian activities._ The Agency must also serve as the nation’s sentinel for new and emerging threats and trends,monitoring the convergence of rogue actors and capabilities, and sources of instability thatcan spread across the globe and undermine U.S. national security. This means that theAgency needs the means, capabilities, reach, and awareness to understand and convey wherethreats are emerging and how U.S. interests may be vulnerable. This requires constantinnovation, analytic rigor, and operational flexibility – hallmarks of the CIA.As a Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I fully appreciate the need for transparencywith the Congressional oversight committees. If the Intelligence Community does not secure thesupport of the appropriate Congressional authorities for its activities, the legislative backlashfrom controversial intelligence failures and controversies can be severe and counterproductive. 10We owe it to our constituents to get to the bottom of intelligence failures – as this Committee didwith the pre-war Iraq intelligence. But we owe it to the brave Americans of the intelligencecommunity not to shirk our responsibility when unauthorized disclosures to the media exposecontroversial intelligence activities, or when Edward Snowden, from the comfort of his Moscowsafe house, misleads the American people about the NSA’s surveillance activities.I cannot stress strongly enough how proud of the CIA’s workforce Americans would be if theycould peek behind the curtains, as the Committee gets to do, to see them in action. Theincredible talent, bravery, and ingenuity these patriots put on the line every day in defense of ourcountry are constant inspirations to me.On my first visit out to the CIA headquarters a few years ago, I was walking through ananalytical targeting cell. I saw a woman who appeared as though she had not slept for weeks,poring over a data set on her screen. I stopped, introduced myself and asked her what she wasworking on. She said she thought she was just hours away from solving a riddle about thelocation of a particularly bad character that she had been pursuing for months. She was notabout to abandon her post. She had her mission and its completion would make America safer.A true patriot. In the past years, I have come to know that there are countless men and womenjust like her working to crush our adversaries with world class intelligence operations.As these quiet professionals grapple with an overwhelming series of challenges in thisincreasingly uncertain world, they deserve our support and our respect. When we ask them to do 11difficult things, they should not have to wonder whether we will stand beside them if things gosideways. We should have their backs. Full stop.When there are intelligence failures, operations that go off the rails, or controversial disclosures,if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, I pledge to come to the Committee in a timely fashion– and be as forthcoming as possible. But I believe that leaders of the Intelligence Communityand Congress owe it to the young men and women who risk their lives for us to do our utmost tokeep mistakes from being politicized.This past weekend, I visited Arlington National Cemetery. I’ve done this many times, but onthis visit, I paid special attention to the markers that commemorate CIA officers who haveperished ensuring our freedom and working to meet America’s intelligence demands. FromAfghanistan to Korea and from Lebanon to Africa, and in so many places most Americans willnever know, Agency officers put their lives at risk. Too often, because of the nature of theirwork, we know little about these men and women and what they do. What we do know, is thatthey were prepared to give so much for each of us. We know the sacrifices of the families ofeach CIA officer as well. As I walked among these heroes, I was reminded of the sacred trustthat will be granted to me if I am confirmed. I will never fail it.I am honored to have been nominated to lead the finest intelligence agency the world has everknown—working to keep safe the people of the greatest nation in the history of civilization. Ifconfirmed, I will be sworn to defend the United States Constitution for the third time in my life –12first as a soldier, then as a member of the House of Representatives, and, now, to work for thePresident and with each of you.I look forward to your questions today."acosta,"Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you this morning. It is anhonor to be here as President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Labor. Iknow today is a very busy day in the Senate, and I am indebted to theCommittee for taking time to conduct this hearing.I want to thank Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz for their kindintroductions. I have known both of them for many years. I trulyappreciate their support and admire their dedication to public service.I am especially grateful for their support given that my biggest fans—mywife Jan and my two young daughters, Delia and Rosalia—cannot behere. Jan is an amazing woman, a fantastic mother, and I am deeplygrateful for her love and support. She is in Miami because Delia, myeldest, has her 1st Grade IOWA tests this week; her sister Rosalia will bein kindergarten next year.Mr. Chairman, I want, in particular, to thank my father and motherbecause my story begins with that of my parents, and it frames myperspective on the important responsibilities I would assume ifconfirmed as Secretary of Labor.My parents fled from a Cuban dictatorship in search of freedom. Theymet in Miami, while in high school, fell in love, and married young. Mymother had me while she was still in her teens. Neither attended college.Growing up, I saw my parents struggle. My mother started out as atypist at a real estate firm. At times, she commuted 90 minutes eachway to her job. My father served in the Army. Later, he tried to start asmall business. But he found that the growing gap between his skillsand the demands of being a small business owner too difficult. He wenton to hold various jobs, ending his working life as an inventory clerk at acell phone store. 2 Our family lived paycheck to paycheck. My grandmother cared for mewhile my parents worked full-time. My parents would often go into debtand, at times, take a second job to make ends meet and to provide mewith the best education possible.I am here today because of them. My success is their success. Theirsacrifice and perseverance made my education possible. They were ableto give me opportunities they did not have because even though theydidn’t attend college, they had something very important – they hadjobs. And though at times they lost their jobs, they were always able tofind another job.* * *Mr. Chairman, today many Americans are facing the same struggles myparents endured, only worse. My parents had jobs; but not allAmericans have jobs.Some Americans have seen jobs go overseas.Some Americans have seen jobs filled by foreign workers. Indeed, I’veread reports that some Americans have been asked to train their foreignreplacements.And some Americans see that jobs are available, but these available jobsrequire skills that they do not have.Helping Americans find good jobs, safe jobs, should not be a partisanissue. In my visits with each of you, it was crystal clear that eachMember of this Committee wants to help American workers find good,safe jobs—even if you do not all agree on how best to realize this goal.I share this goal with you. We may not always agree on the how, but atleast let us agree on the need. If confirmed, I hope to have the benefit ofan ongoing dialogue with each of you about how we can advance thesegoals within the context of a dynamic, global economy that is changing 3 more rapidly with each passing year, and within the constraints oflimited resources.***I would like to close with a brief discussion of a few items in particular.The first is the “skills gap.” As I visited with Members of thisCommittee, I repeatedly heard that in your states the jobs are there, butthe skills too often are not. In one of your states, for example, acommunity college was teaching welding techniques that employers nolonger used. Not surprisingly, the students could not get a job when theygraduated.We can and must work to reduce the skills gap. We need to make betterefforts to align job training with the skills the market demands of itsworkers, especially as advancing technology changes the types of jobsavailable in our economy. The Department of Labor, along with localgovernments, industry, and educational institutions, can partner to havesubstantial positive impact on American workers. This is the vision ofthe Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), ofapprenticeship programs, of Job Corps and of many other programs atDOL. If confirmed, I will work with you to maximize the impact ofevery taxpayer dollar Congress directs towards job training programs.Second, good jobs should also be safe jobs. Congress has enactedworkplace safety laws. The Department of Labor enforces these, and ifconfirmed, I will work to enforce the laws under the Department’sjurisdiction fully and fairly. As a former prosecutor, I will always be onthe side of the law and not any particular constituency.Finally, the Department of Labor was formed a bit more than 100 yearsago, when the Department of Commerce and Labor was split into two.The intent was this: that a voice for Commerce and a voice for Workerswithin the Executive Branch would promote better decision-making. 4 I support this concept. An advocate for the American workforce withinthe Administration is important. Whether it is those who are working,those who still seek work, those who are discouraged or underemployed,or those who have retired, if confirmed as the Secretary of Labor, I willadvocate for them. I am proud to have the support both of several dozenbusiness groups and of several private-sector and key public safetyunions, who remember with respect my prior government work at DOJand the NLRB. They know that while we did not always agree on theoutcome, I always listened and sought principled solutions.If confirmed, I hope we—this Committee and the Executive Branch—can work together in the same way to address the need for good jobs,safe jobs and access to training in the skills that the changing workplacedemands.Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to answering yourquestions. "zinke,"Thank you, Madam Chairman, Ranking MemberCantwell, and members of the committee. Thank you also MontanaSenators Tester and Daines for their kind remarks, leadership andcontinued service on behalf of our great Treasure State.It is an honor to appear before this esteemed Senate Committeeon Energy and Natural Resources.Before beginning my remarks, I would like to introduce and recognizemembers of my family who have joined me today. My wife,Lolita, who is also a member of President-elect’s Hispanic AdvisoryCouncil; my two grandchildren, Matilda and Charlotte; my daughter,Jennifer; and, her husband, Jack.The CHAIRMAN. Welcome.Mr. ZINKE. And for the record, I did tell my daughter, ‘‘Don’t jointhe Navy and don’t marry a Navy SEAL.’’ And she did both.[Laughter.]My sons, Wolfgang and Konrad, are back at school and hopefullystudying today, so they will not be with us.As a son of a plumber and a kid who grew up in a small timbertown and railroad town in Whitefish near Glacier Park, I am humbledto be before you as the President-elect’s designee for Secretaryof the Interior. I am also deeply humbled because of the great responsibilitythe position holds to be the steward of our majesticlands, the champion of our great Indian nations and the managerand voice of our diverse wildlife.Upfront, I am an unapologetic admirer of Teddy Roosevelt andbelieve he had it right when he placed under Federal protectionmillions of our acres of Federal lands and set aside much of it asour national forests. Today, those lands provide Americans the opportunityto hike, fish, camp, recreate and enjoy the great outdoors.It was on these lands that my father taught me to hunt and fish,and the Boy Scouts taught me the principles of environmentalstewardship and the importance of public access. It is also on theselands that many communities, like the community I grew up in,rely on to harvest timber, mine and to provide our nation with criticalenergy. Without question, our public lands are America’s treasures andare rich in diversity. I fully recognize and appreciate there arelands that deserve special recognition and are better managedunder the John Muir model of wilderness, where man has a lighttouch and is an observer. I also fully recognize the preponderanceof our Federal holdings are better suited under the Pinchot modelof multiple use, using best practices, sustainable policies and objectivescience.During the recent centennial of our National Park Service, Ifound myself at a ceremony at Yellowstone National Park, our firstnational park established by Congress and signed into law byPresident Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872.As I enjoyed the celebration under the famous Roosevelt Arch, Icould not help but notice the words etched on the stone above, ‘‘Forthe benefit and enjoyment of the people.’’ I also could not help butnotice on the plaque on the side, it said ‘‘Erected by Congress.’’When I saw that, I thought this is the perfect policy of land thatour great nation should uphold.In order to have great deeds and accomplish great things, bothsides have to work together. Higher purpose can only be achievedby both sides coming together for higher purpose. In a nutshell,that is my commitment to you.If confirmed, I will work with each of you to ensure our publiclands reflect higher purpose, so that our children’s children, mygranddaughters’ children, can look back and say we did it right.I have almost met every member of this committee, and I understandthat each state is different. I also understand that issueswithin your state are different and you have different priorities,but I am confident that we can work together to get the job done.When asked about what my goals might be, I would say there arethree immediate tasks.The first is to restore trust and working with, rather thanagainst, local communities and states. I fully recognize that thereis distrust, anger and even hatred against some Federal managementpolicies. Being a listener and a listening advocate rather thana deaf adversary is a good start.Second is to prioritize the estimated $12.5 billion in backlog ofmaintenance and repair of our national parks. The President-electis committed to a jobs and infrastructure bill, and I am committedand need your help in making sure that bill includes our nationaltreasures.Third, to ensure that the professionals in the front line, that isour managers and rangers, have the right tools, the right resourcesand the flexibility to make the right decisions to give a voice to thepeople they represent.As a former Montana State Senator and current Congressman,I have learned a lot since I was a SEAL in the deserts of Iraq. Toaccomplish my mission as Secretary of Interior, if confirmed, Iknow that I am going to need your help. I am going to need yourconfidence and even perhaps your prayers.I look forward to answering your questions and, if confirmed,representing the interests of our great nation in giving a voice toall Americans, to include our great Indian nations, on how we manage,sustain our public lands and the treasures they contain. Madam Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear beforeyou and this committee, and I look forward to your questions. "ben carson,"Yes. Well, thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, SenatorBrown. Thank you to Senator Rubio for that kind introduction.Thank you to the Members of the Committee, virtually all of whomI have met with, who have been very gracious, and I very muchappreciate that. Thanks also to President-elect Trump for hisfriendship, leadership, and for his trust for such an important role.I would like to introduce my family. Directly behind me is mywife, Candy, of 41 years, my college sweetheart, and starting fromthis end, my oldest son, Murray, another Yalie, who is an engineer,and his wife, Lerone, who is a youth pastor. And my daughter-inlaw,Merlynn, who is a physician and a businesswoman, and mygranddaughter, Tesora, who is just a sweetie; and my middle son,Ben Junior, or BJ, as we affectionately call him, a very successfulentrepreneur businessman. And our good friend, Marcia Jackson,wife of former Secretary Alphonso Jackson. And I think you probablyknow the others here, but Rhoeyce is—oh, there he is, OK. Myyoungest son, Rhoeyce, and his father-in-law, Alexander Shabo.Thank you. You know, as a youngster, I remember actually feelingthat I was pretty lucky. We lived in a 750-square-foot GI homein southwest Detroit that actually had a lawn and a little one-cargarage, and we thought that was paradise. And then my parentsgot divorced, and, you know, my mother discovered that my father was married to someone else. And she did not have any skills. Basically,a third-grade education. We had no place to live. She couldnot afford the house, so we ended up moving to Boston, moving inwith relatives. So I have actually in my life understood what housinginsecurity was.We were there in Boston for a couple of years, and I rememberas a 9-year-old looking through a building across the street, out ofwhich all the windows had been broken, and a sunbeam was shiningthrough it, and it made me think about my future. I rememberthinking that I probably would never live to be 25, because that iswhat I saw around me, but my mother had very different ideas.She worked extraordinarily hard as a domestic, leaving the houseat 5 in the morning, getting back at midnight, day after day afterday, and her strong desire was not to be dependent on anybodyelse. And people were always criticizing her, and they said, ‘‘Youhave two boys. You can be on Aid to Dependent Children.’’ And shesaid, ‘‘No, I cannot.’’And she worked very hard. She would sometimes take us to thehomes that she cleaned, and many of them were fabulous homes,and she would say, ‘‘Would you rather live in this wonderful placeor would you rather live where we live?’’ And she would say, ‘‘Youknow, the person who has this most to do with determining whereyou live is you. It is not somebody else. It is not the environment.’’You know, that made a very strong impression on me, and sheinsisted later on, when we were able to return to Detroit, still notto our idyllic home—we still could not afford to live there, still ina multifamily, dilapidated place with rats and roaches—but, nevertheless,she was independent, and we still had that dream of beingable to get back there.But I was a terrible student, and she insisted that I read. Sheinsisted that my brother read. We were not very enthusiastic aboutthat, but back in those days you had to do what your parents toldyou. And as I started reading, I began to discover a whole newworld. We were desperately poor, but between the covers of thosebooks I could go anywhere. I could be anybody. I could do anything.And within the space of a year and a half, I went from the bottomof the class to the top of the class, much to the consternation ofall those students who used to call me ‘‘dummy.’’ They were nowcoming to me, saying, ‘‘Bennie, Bennie, how do you work this problem?’’And I would say, ‘‘Sit at my feet, youngster, while I instructyou.’’[Laughter.]Dr. CARSON. I was perhaps a little obnoxious, but it sure feltgood to say that to those turkeys.But, you know, I had a very different impression of who I wasat that point, and, you know, it is one of the reasons that Candyand I started the Carson Scholars Fund, a component of which arereading rooms. And we put in reading rooms all over the country.We have 165 of them now, primarily in Title I schools, where kidscome from homes with no books. They go to a school with no libraryor poorly funded library. They are not likely to become readers.As you know, 70 to 80 percent of high school dropouts are functionallyilliterate, and if we can truncate that downstream, you canchange the trajectory of their lives. And that is really what it is about—changing lives and providing opportunities for people. Itmakes all the difference in the world.You know, we had a program at Hopkins, and I would have 700to 800 students at a time come in on a regular basis. If you cameto Johns Hopkins, some of you probably had me. You saw all theschool buses around. That was bringing in the kids and trying toencourage them in terms of what they could do. And I got involvedin a lot of the programs, involved more with the East BaltimoreCommunity Development Inc., and with the community school, andwith all the schools and the mayors.And, you know, that was a very important part of my life, eventhough I was an extraordinarily busy surgeon. And I do believethat Government can play a very important role. I know some havedistorted what I have said about Government, but I believe Governmentis important, and it is there, I believe, to promote life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness.What has happened too often is that people who seemingly meanwell have promoted things that do not encourage the developmentof innate talent in people, and, hence, we have generation aftergeneration of people living in dependent situations. It is not thatthey are bad people. It is that this is what they have been given.This is all they know, in many cases.I think we have an opportunity here to do something about thatif we take a more holistic approach. When we talk about HUD traditionally,most people think putting roofs over the heads of poorpeople. But it has the ability to be so much more than that, particularlyif we take a holistic approach. And we think about howdo we develop our fellow human beings. I see each individual ashuman capital that can be developed to become part of the enginethat drives our Nation or, if not developed, becomes part of theload. And we are the ones who are tasked with helping to makethe difference.So I do believe that Government is extraordinarily important,and one of the things that I want to do, instead of just listeningto the sage people of Washington, DC—and there are some wisepeople here—I want to go on a listening tour. I want to hear fromthe people with boots on the ground, who are actually administeringprograms, who are benefiting from the programs. I wantto see what actually works and what does not work. I want to analyzewhy it works and why it does not work.Before I go on the road to do that, I want to do that at HUD.We have people there who have been there for 10, 20, 30, even 40years, and I do not think a lot of people listen to what they haveto say. I suspect that they have garnered a tremendous amount ofinformation, and I want to get that information from them. I wantto work with them on a regular basis.Some people say, ‘‘But medicine—why would you go into somethinglike HUD?’’ Well, I actually believe that there is a tremendousnexus, a great intersection, because good health has a lot todo with a good environment, and after working so hard on so manypeople and then putting them back into an environment with leadand with all kinds of inducements for asthma and other chronicdiseases, that is not very helpful. And I am looking forward to the Safe and Healthy Homes Program at HUD and enhancing that programvery significantly.Why is all this so important? Well, you know, there was a Brookingsstudy, a very important study, which showed that if people didthree things, their likelihood of living in poverty would be 2 percentor less, and that is really what we want to do, keep people fromliving in poverty. Those three things were graduate from highschool, get a job, and wait until you are married to have children.Think about that. And, you know, what that means is that thereare points of intervention, things that we can do to make a differencein people’s lives.Also, think about this fact. In terms of our human capital thatis being wasted, we have 5 percent of the world’s population and25 percent of the prison inmates. That means there is somethingwrong. We have high recidivism rates. We have people who go intoprison with little education and little in the way of skills, and theycome out with little education and little in the way of skills. Sowhat are they going to do? They go back to doing what they weredoing before; hence, we have these high recidivism rates. We needto think about how do we give them education, how do we givethem skills, how do we cultivate the innate talent that is in thoseindividuals so that they become part of the engine once again.And recognize, we only have 330 million people. Now, thatsounds like a lot of people, but that is a quarter of the people theyhave in India or China. We are going to have to compete with thoseNations into the future, which means we have to develop all of ourtalent.Now, you say, ‘‘Well, that all sounds great and wonderful, butyou were a pediatric neurosurgeon. How could you have anythingwonderful to say about any of these things?’’ Well, you know, Ihave to chuckle when I hear people say things like that becausethere is an assumption that you can only do one thing and that wehave these very limited brains and they are incapable of learninganything else. I find that kind of humorous, particularly knowingwhat the human brain is capable of. Billions of neurons, hundredsof billions of interconnections can process more than 2 million bitsof information in 1 second. Any brain can do that. You cannot overloadit. You hear some people say you overload your brain. Youcannot do it. If you learned one new fact every second, it wouldtake you more than 3 million years to challenge the capacity ofyour brain. So we do have the ability to learn.More importantly, we have the ability to work together, and thatis absolutely critical. We in America—Democrats, Republicans,Independents—we are not each other’s enemies. We must come tothat understanding. There are real people out there who reallywant to destroy us, but we do not need to be doing that ourselves.We need to be combining our collective intellect, and one of thethings that I learned in my private life as a board member at Kelloggfor 18 years and Costco for 16 years is how to select a goodCEO. And I will tell you, a good CEO does not necessarily knoweverything about the business. He is not a marketing specialist. Hemay not be a financial specialist. There are many things that hedoes not know, but he knows how to pick those people and how touse them. And that is one of the marks of good leadership. So, in closing, I have been very fortunate to be able to move fromthe bottom rung of the socioeconomic level to the top rung and tounderstand how people feel in all those different levels, and I gotto tell you, we are all in the same boat, and if part of the boatsinks, the rest of it is going down, too. And it means what we needto do is exercise true compassion. True compassion is not keepingpeople in a situation where we can feel good about what we aredoing. True compassion is putting them in the situation where theycan feel good about where they are going.Thank you. "kirstjen nielsen ,"Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member McCaskill, and distinguished Membersof the Committee: it is an honor to appear before you today as youconsider my nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Iam humbled and grateful to the President for the trust he has placed inme to lead DHS during such a critical time.I also want to thank Senators Rubio and Portman for their kind wordsand introductions. Thank you to former Secretaries Ridge and Chertofffor their statements- it was an honor to serve and work with you and Ilook forward to your continued leadership and stewardship of ourhomeland security enterprise. Finally, I want to thank former Secretary,now Chief of Staff, General Kelly for his leadership, example and 46years of steadfast service to our nation.Please allow me to take a moment to introduce the members of myfamily who are here with me today. My dad, James, my brother,Fletcher, my sister, Ashley, my aunt and uncle, Mary Ellen and TrevorBurton and my cousin Andrew Bragg. I was raised to believe in ourcountry and its founding principles and ideals; to serve our country; andto appreciate and be thankful every day for the freedoms we hold dear asAmericans. I am beyond grateful for the values they have instilled in meand their unwavering love and support throughout my life. Thank youfor your continued encouragement and for traveling so far to be here.If confirmed as the sixth Secretary of Homeland Security, it will be thegreatest honor of my life to again work with and support the remarkablemen and women of the Department of Homeland Security who put it all on the line every day to secure the Homeland. I can’t say enough aboutthe incredible work of the people of DHS many of whom put their liveson the line daily to ensure the safety and security of our nation.Over more than two decades, I have dedicated my career to working onhomeland security issues. In both the public (legislative and executivebranches) and private sectors, I have utilized my knowledge ofhomeland security policy, strategy, and operations, as well as myexpertise in risk and resilience, cybersecurity, critical infrastructureprotection, and emergency management to help make our nation moresecure.After working on transportation, defense, and government affairs issuesand legislation for Senator Connie Mack, I practiced corporatetransactional law during which time I learned how private sectorcompany operations are directly affected by organizational structuresand delineation of roles and responsibilities. My service in the executivebranch began in 2002 at the Transportation Security Administration. Atthat time, TSA was still part of the Department of Transportation and theformation of DHS was being contemplated. It was an honor to workalongside the countless public servants who stood up TSA and tackledthe tough security challenges we faced after the attacks on September11th and who later helped to stand up the Department of HomelandSecurity.I was subsequently commissioned by President Bush to serve as aSpecial Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and SeniorDirector for Prevention, Preparedness, and Response. Charged withinteragency policy development and coordination, I led the developmentof new national strategies and policies, articulating the roles of all levelsof government and the private sector in protecting our nation’s criticalinfrastructure and in strengthening our information sharing. During thistime the Nation experienced the devastation of the Gulf Coast thatresulted from Hurricane Katrina. Based on the lessons identified fromthe response to Hurricane Katrina, I led the update and revisions to our disaster response plans to strengthen our efforts moving into the future. Iworked with Congress to draft the Post Katrina Emergency ManagementReform Act, and co-authored the White House Katrina lessons learnedreport. As we’ve seen again during this year’s devastating hurricaneseason, DHS plays a crucial role in disaster preparedness, mitigation,response and recovery working closely with public and private sectorpartners. I have worked closely with all facets of our emergencypreparedness community, and should I be confirmed, look forward tohelping to ensure our nation’s resilience to natural disasters, terroristattacks and other major emergencies.While each aspect of the Department’s mission is important, I believeone of the most significant for our nation’s future is cybersecurity andthe overall security and resilience of our nation’s critical infrastructure.The scope and pace of cyberattacks against our federal networks and thecontrol systems that run our critical infrastructure are continuallyincreasing, with attacks growing evermore complex and each moresophisticated than the last. Cyber criminals and nation states arecontinually looking for ways to exploit our hyperconnectivity andreliance on IT systems. My cybersecurity experience in both the publicsector, having chaired the first White House Policy CoordinationCommittee on cybersecurity, and the private sector, advisinggovernment and non-government officials on the development andexecution of strategies to mitigate risks and enhance the resilience of ourcritical infrastructure has prepared me well for the multi-facetedchallenge that is increasing our resilience to cyberattacks. I look forwardto working with experts at the Department, and within the interagencyand the private sector to thwart threats, protect our networks andessential functions and secure our nation’s interests in cyberspace.At the start of the current administration, I also had the honor of servingas Chief of Staff at DHS under then-Secretary Kelly. During that time, Iworked closely with state and local officials, cabinet secretaries, foreignpartners, and members of Congress on all of the issues that DHS faces. Ihad the opportunity to develop strong working relationships with current DHS leadership, and helped to develop many of the Department’scurrent key priorities and strategies.Our nation is facing a complex threat landscape that is constantlyevolving. The threats we face are too many and too varied for any oneentity to address them successfully alone. I understand the risks and theresulting challenges the Department is tasked with resolving and I ameager to get to work with all of DHS’ partners – domestic andinternational from all sectors- to find solutions. From my experience atTSA in the early 2000s, to my time in the private sector supporting thehomeland security enterprise, I have gained a vast understanding of theDepartment, its components, and the many challenges it faces.If confirmed I pledge to continue the record of exceptional leadershipthat General Kelly and Acting Secretary Duke have established at DHS.I vow to the men and women of DHS, to you, and to the hundreds ofmillions of Americans who rely on DHS every day, to work tirelessly toeffectively execute each mission at the Department of HomelandSecurity. I will work every day to enforce our laws; secure our borders,coasts, and waterways; and protect Americans from dangerouscriminals, terrorists, cyberattacks, and the other threats facing ourhomeland. I also pledge to work every day to give the dedicated menand women of the Department the support, tools and resources theyneed, and deserve, to carry out their difficult- and often dangerousmissions.Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. ShouldI be confirmed, I look forward to partnering with the Committee and thefull Congress to protect and secure our homeland.I look forward to answering the Committee’s questions"azar,"I’m pleased to be joined today by my wife, Jennifer, my daughter, Claire, my son, Alex,and my father, Dr. Alex Azar. Unfortunately my mother, Lynda, could not be here today, andmost tragically my step-mother Wilma passed away just last July from cancer. Thank you all.Having an opportunity such as this does not happen without family support and guidance.Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the Committee forthe opportunity to appear before you as the President’s nominee to be the Secretary of Health andHuman Services.Secretary Thompson and Secretary Leavitt, thank you so much for those kind words andfor your friendship and mentorship over the years.I thank President Trump for the confidence he has bestowed on me.Ninety-seven years ago, my grandfather—an impoverished teenager who spoke noEnglish—stepped out of steerage on the S.S. Argentina, completing his long journey fromAmioun, Lebanon, to America. As he entered the receiving hall at Ellis Island, he met anindividual in a military uniform. That person possessed the power to admit him or to send himback to poverty and uncertainty. That person was a member of the United States Public HealthService. It is a testament to all that I love about this country that just 97 years after mygrandfather went through his six-second physical on Ellis Island with no discernable prospectsother than the political, economic, and religious freedom America offers, his grandson might be 2in charge of that very Public Health Service, as well as all of the other world-renownedcomponents of the Department of Health and Human Services.The mission of HHS is to enhance and protect the health and the well-being of allAmericans, through programs that touch every single American in some way, every single day.Through its outstanding leaders and career staff, HHS is primed to meet that challenge. The taskis humbling. Marshalling and leading the incredible resources of the Department requireinnovating, never being satisfied with the status quo, and anticipating and preparing for thefuture. I gained these skills in the dark days after 9/11, as we faced the health and humanconsequences of those attacks, through the subsequent anthrax attacks and preparedness forpotential further biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear attacks, in the implementation ofour completely novel Part D prescription drug benefit for seniors, by helping to build global,national, state, and local pandemic flu preparedness, in our response to threats such as SARS andmonkeypox, in our efforts to continue to reform welfare programs to make them as modern,responsive, and empowering as possible for the individuals and families we serve, throughinnovation in the private sector to bring life-improving therapies to our people and the people ofthe world, and in harnessing the power of big data and predictive analytics to make us moreefficient and more capable of serving our fellow Americans.With a department the size and scope of HHS, it can be difficult to prioritize.Nonetheless, should I be confirmed, I do envision focusing my personal efforts in four criticalareas. First, drug prices are too high. The President has made this clear. So have I. Through myexperience helping to implement Part D and with my extensive knowledge of how insurance,manufacturers, pharmacy, and government programs work together, I believe I bring skills and 3experiences to the table that can help us address these issues, while still encouraging discoveryso Americans have access to high quality care.Second, we must make healthcare more affordable, more available, and more tailored towhat individuals want and need in their care. We all share a common concern for our fellowAmericans who are struggling to achieve access to quality healthcare, even if we do notnecessarily always agree on how best to go about addressing that challenge. Under the statusquo, premiums have been skyrocketing year after year, and choices have been dwindling. Wemust address these challenges for those who have insurance coverage and for those who havebeen pushed out or left out of the insurance market by the Affordable Care Act.Third, we must harness the power of Medicare to shift the focus in our healthcare systemfrom paying for procedures and sickness to paying for health and outcomes. We can betterchannel the power of health information technology, and leverage what is best in our programsand in the private, competitive marketplace to ensure the individual patient is at the center ofdecision making and his or her needs are being met with greater transparency and accountability.Finally, we must heed President Trump’s call-to-action and tackle the scourge of theopioid epidemic that is destroying so many individuals, families, and communities. We needaggressive prevention, education, regulatory, and enforcement efforts to stop over-prescribingand overuse of these legal and illegal drugs. And we need compassionate treatment for thosesuffering from dependence and addiction.These are serious challenges that require a serious-minded sense of purpose, and, ifconfirmed, I will work with the superb team at HHS to deliver serious results.I thank President Trump for this important opportunity to serve the American people, andI thank you for your consideration of my nomination."rick perry,"U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, January 19, 2017Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Cantwell, and distinguished members of thiscommittee, it is an honor to appear before you as President elect Trump’s nominee for theSecretary of Energy.This confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me, and theindividual discussions I had with many of the members of this committee were the mostimportant aspect of that process.I especially want to thank Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell for speaking passionatelyand frankly about their priorities for the country as it relates to energy policy. You may be ofdifferent parties, but I noted during those meetings what you have in common.Both of you talked passionately about energy development, the safety and reliability of ournuclear stockpile, the vital role of our national labs, the critical importance of grid security,and the unique situations in your states. And both of you talked about these complex issueswithout the benefit of notes. You know well the challenges and issues facing the Secretary ofEnergy. If I am confirmed, I look forward to working with you.Before I go further, I want to recognize my strongest advocate and supporter who has beenthere every step of the way since we met at a piano recital in 1958 – my wife Anita. It has beenquite the journey for us, from a dryland cotton farm with a house that had just received powerfrom the Rural Electrification Agency, to appointment to serve as our nation’s Secretary ofEnergy. With us today is our pride and joy, our daughter Sydney, and her husband Brett.I arrive at this appointment with three decades of experience in elected service – as a staterepresentative, a state commissioner of agriculture, lieutenant governor, and governor ofTexas for 14 years.During my three and a half terms as governor, I led a state that created 2.2 million jobs, thatadded more people than any other state, and would stand alone as the world’s 12th largesteconomy.We were also the nation’s leading energy producing state – not just in terms of oil and gas, butwind energy too. I have firsthand experience with the shale energy boom that revolutionizedAmerican energy and with state-led cleanup efforts to improve our environment. As Governor,I also learned the management skills for running a state, and have the executive experiencenecessary for leading an organization as large as the Department of Energy.From this experience, I learned how important energy is to the American economy, and thegreat responsibility we have to take care of what we’ve been given and to protect our citizens.If I am so fortunate as to be confirmed, this experience will inform my priorities at theDepartment. I am committed to keeping Americans safe. Nuclear security is the largest portion of theDepartment of Energy’s budget. I will be focused on continuing to protect and modernize thenation’s nuclear stockpile. As a former Air Force pilot during the days of the Cold War, Iunderstand the deterrent value of our nuclear weapons systems, and the vital role they play inkeeping the peace.Another aspect of security is ensuring the reliability of our electric grid and protecting againstcyber security attacks. I am committed to undertaking enhanced security measures wherenecessary and assisting with recovery efforts, so that Americans can depend on stable sourcesof power. I will draw upon my years of experience as governor of a coastal state in organizingemergency response personnel to handle disasters effectively and efficiently.If confirmed, I will advocate and promote American energy in all forms, and that includesrenewables. America has been blessed with vast natural resources and the technology toutilize them. I am committed to helping provide stable, reliable, affordable, and secure sourcesof American energy. An American first energy strategy is important to create jobs and growthe economy.I am a major proponent of maintaining American leadership in the area of scientific inquiry. Isupport the academic and government mission of basic research, even when it will not yieldbenefits for a generation. Our scientists and labs are the envy of the world. I look forward tovisiting our national labs this year, if confirmed, and learning more about the unique workthey are doing. I have a long record of aggressively courting leading scientific minds to bringinnovation and job creation to my home state.Furthermore, I understand, and am committed to, the vital role the Department of Energymaintains in environmental cleanup, and specifically cleaning up nuclear waste, a legacy of theCold War. I have experience in dealing with the difficult challenges of transporting and storinglow-level waste in my home state of Texas. I know this is a daunting task at the federal level,with 35 states temporarily housing waste from various nuclear programs. I look forward toworking with the members of this committee to address the concerns many of you are hearingback home about nuclear waste facilities.In summary, I am committed to modernizing our nuclear stockpile, promoting and developingAmerican energy in all forms, advancing the department’s critical science and technologymission, and carefully disposing of nuclear waste.In my limited time, let me address a couple more issues.I have learned a great deal about the important work being done every day by the outstandingmen and women of the DOE. I have spoken several times to Secretary Moniz and hispredecessors. If confirmed, my desire is to lead this agency in a thoughtful manner,surrounding myself with expertise on the core functions of the department.My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy donot reflect my current thinking.In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, Iregret recommending its elimination.If confirmed, I will enter this role excited and passionate about advancing the core missions ofthe DOE, and drawing greater attention to the vital role played by the agency and the hardworking men and women who dedicate themselves in pursuit of these missions.Second, let me speak to the issue of climate change.I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it isalso caused by manmade activity. The question is how do we address it in a thoughtful waythat doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy, or American jobs.In Texas, we have a record of taking action to address environmental challenges, includingclimate change. Despite a fast-growing population and one of the largest petro-chemicalrefining industries in the world, we saw our climate and air quality improve.Our power plants reduced their carbon output by 17 percent, sulfur dioxide by 56 percent andnitrous oxide by 66 percent. We decommissioned 137 older, dirtier power plants whileproviding incentives for clean technology, such as clean coal and carbon capture andunderground storage. In Houston, the billion dollar Petra Nova plant will be opening soonusing carbon capture sequestration. We are also using carbon injected into wells for enhancedoil field recovery.I signed a law to retrofit more than 15,000 engines under the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan,and we have provided incentives for energy efficiency. Our willingness to develop natural gas,and tap shale formations has helped not only Texas reduce its carbon footprint, but otherstates and Mexico as well.But we truly advocated an all of the above strategy, reducing carbon emissions not justthrough development of cleaner fossil fuels, but through the development of renewablesources too. During my time as governor, Texas took the national lead in wind energydevelopment, and now produces more wind power than all but five countries.When it comes to climate change, I am committed to making decisions based on sound scienceand that also take into account the economic impact.We need an energy policy for the 21st century that is focused on promoting American energyin all forms. I am committed to working with this committee and the incoming Administrationto do so. This is a historic time for America and for the energy sector. I would be honored tobe a part of it.Thank you."devos,"Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, Senators, thank you for the opportunity to bewith you this afternoon.I want to begin by thanking my family for their support: my husband, Dick, my sons, anddaughters, and sons-in-law -- as well as the rest of my family, including five grandchildren, whocould not join us today.I am honored that President-elect Trump asked me to join his team and am grateful for hisdedication to education. If confirmed, I look forward to working with him, Vice President-electPence and all of you to bring educational opportunity to every family in this great nation.While we may have differences, I think we can all agree that learning as a lifelong pursuit is afundamental American virtue.We are blessed beyond measure with educators who pour themselves into students.The schools in which they work are as diverse as the students they educate. In fact, all of us here– and our children – have attended a mix of traditional publicly-funded and private schools. Thisis a reflection of the diversity that is today’s American public education.Growing up in Holland, Michigan, I attended local Christian schools and then Calvin College.My greatest educational influence in life was a public school teacher named Elsa Prince.While her students called her Mrs. Prince, to this day, I just call her “mom.”When Dick and I became parents, education took on a whole new meaning. We recognized thatother parents were not able to make similar decisions about their children’s education, based ontheir income or the zip code in which they lived.When our oldest reached school age, we visited The Potter's House, a Christian school whichserves many low income families in my hometown. We saw the struggles and sacrifices many ofthese families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children. For methis was not just an issue of public policy but of national injustice.I committed to do something about it, and it’s become my life’s work. I applaud the great workof The Potter’s House and its founder John Booy – who is here with us today – he and his teamof teachers are doing a great job. But here’s the sad reality: in the past 28 years, the need anddemand for these other options have grown, unabated. I share President-elect Trump’s view that it’s time to shift the debate from what the systemthinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve.Parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning meets the needs of everychild, and they know other options exist, whether magnet, virtual, charter, home, religious, orany combination thereof. Yet, too many parents are denied access to the full range of options…choices that many of us -- here in this room -- have exercised for our own children.Why, in 2017, are we still questioning parents’ ability to exercise educational choice for theirchildren? I am a firm believer that parents should be empowered to choose the learningenvironment that’s best for their individual children.The vast majority of students in this country will continue to attend public schools. If confirmed,I will be a strong advocate for great public schools. But, if a school is troubled, or unsafe, or nota good fit for a child – perhaps they have a special need that is going unmet -- we should supporta parent’s right to enroll their child in a high quality alternative.It’s really pretty simple.Every child in America deserves to be in a safe environment that is free from discrimination.Every student in America dreams of developing his or her unique talents and gifts.Every parent in America dreams of a future when their children have access to schools with therigor, challenges, and safe environments that successfully prepare them for a brighter, morehopeful tomorrow.And every teacher in America dreams of breaking free from standardization, so that they candeploy their unique creativity and innovate with their students.Our nation’s schools are filled with talented, devoted professionals, who successfully meet theneeds of many, many children. But even our best schools don't work for all. This isn’t the faultof teachers, but a reality that all students are unique, learn differently, and excel at their ownpace.Students also face new challenges today. In particular, our high school graduates are havingincreasing difficulty accessing affordable higher education.Escalating tuition is pricing aspiring and talented students out of college. Others are burdenedwith debts that will take years – or even decades -- to pay off.There is no magic wand to make the debt go away, but we do need to take action. It would be amistake to shift that burden to struggling taxpayers without first addressing why tuition hasgotten so high.For starters, we need to embrace new pathways of learning. For too long a college degree hasbeen pushed as the only avenue for a better life. The old and expensive brick-mortar-and-ivymodel is not the only one that will lead to a prosperous future. Craftsmanship is not a fallback -but a noble pursuit.Students should make informed choices about what type of education they want to pursue posthigh school and have access to high quality options. President-elect Trump and I agree we needto support all post-secondary avenues, including trade and vocational schools, and communitycolleges.Of course, on every one of these issues, Congress will play a vital role.If confirmed, I look forward to working with you to enact solutions that empower parents andstudents, provide high quality options and spend tax dollars wisely.We will work together to ensure the Every Student Succeeds Act is implemented as Congressintended -- with local communities freed from burdensome regulations from Washington. And Ilook forward to working with Congress and all stakeholders to reauthorize the Higher EducationAct to meet the needs of today’s college students.President-elect Trump and I know it won’t be Washington, D.C. that unlocks our nation’spotential, nor a bigger bureaucracy, tougher mandates or a federal agency. The answer is localcontrol and listening to parents, students and teachers.For nearly three decades, I’ve been involved in education, as a volunteer, an advocate forchildren, and a voice for parents.I’ve worked as an in-school mentor for students in the Grand Rapids Public Schools, and havehad the privilege of interacting with students and their families and teachers in ways that havechanged my life and my perspective about education forever.I’ve worked with Governors, legislators, and business and community leaders to expandeducational opportunity through options that are making a lifetime of difference for hundreds ofthousands of kids this year alone.And, I’ve worked with many dedicated teachers who strive every day to help students achieve,fulfill their potential, and prepare them for the global challenges that they will face.For me, it’s simple: I trust parents, and I believe in our children.Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you. I look forward to answering yourquestions."sonny perdue,"Good Morning Chairman Roberts, Ranking Member Stabenow, and distinguishedMembers of the Committee. It is an honor to be with you today as the President’snominee to serve as our nation’s 31st Secretary of Agriculture. I know fromvisiting with you in your offices, there was some anxiety over whether there wouldbe a Secretary of Agriculture nominee, but I must say with all humility I canmuster, I think the president saved the best for last.I’d like to thank each of you for making time to meet individually with me over thelast few weeks to discuss the current state of our agricultural community and theissues we will face in the future. I hope and trust that these meetings will not justbe introductory episodes, but ongoing opportunities to listen and learn from oneanother. And, I’d also like to thank each of you for the opportunity to be here todayto answer all your questions as you consider my nomination and carry out theSenate’s very important constitutional role in this confirmation process.I think it is altogether fitting and proper that this Committee convenes this hearingduring the same week we celebrate National Agriculture Week. I hope that, byworking together, we can continue our nation’s agricultural preeminence, buildingthe innovative progress of years gone by and growing to meet the needs anddemands of customers and consumers here in America and around the world.However, before I continue and address my priorities, I would like to take amoment and introduce my family members who are here with me today. I’maccompanied by my lovely wife, Mary. I had no idea, when we married 44 yearsago, I was marrying such a prolific grandmother. As you can see, seated with Maryare our four children, their spouses, and 12 of our 14 grandchildren, all of whomare more familiar with my being called Big buddy, rather than any other titles I’vehad. I’m also pleased and frankly humbled, after seven years, to have over 40 ofmy former staff present, who labored side-by-side with me in serving the state andthe people of Georgia.You’ve all read my bio and poured over my personal and professional history, butif you’ll indulge me, I’d like to tell you a little bit about myself.As a youngster growing up on a dairy and diversified row crop farm in a rural areaof Georgia I never fully realized that the blessings of purposeful, meaningful workwould serve me as well as they have in life. When I was a young boy feeding thecalves and plowing the fields, I was an integral part of the workforce there on myfather’s farm.My mother was an English teacher for 42 years, so I benefitted from her teachingsas well … not just by her raising me with the beliefs I hold so dear to my heart, butbeing an English teacher, she even made sure I knew all about dangling participles.It was a great life. I had a blessed upbringing with wonderful memories. Myfavorite hobbies as a youngster were training bird dogs, riding my horse Trigger,and playing Little League baseball. Even as a youngster, I was determined andgoal-oriented. Early on, I set my heart on becoming a veterinarian, so, after highschool, I enrolled at the University of Georgia, where I also walked on to playfootball for the UGA Bulldogs. Play is probably not the operative word, but I wason the team! Realizing that my future was not on the football field, I decided toapply myself to my studies.As I entered Veterinary school in 1967, Viet Nam was roiling, so I signed up for anearly commissioning program in the U.S. Air Force. As I finished my veterinaryeducation in 1971, I began to fulfil the active duty service to which I had agreed. Iwas assigned to Columbus, Ohio as a base veterinarian, whose primaryresponsibilities were food safety, public health, and sanitation.Following completion of my active duty commitment, I joined a small veterinarypractice in Raleigh, North Carolina. I soon realized, even though our practice wasthriving, that I missed the farm and my former agricultural way of life. So, in 1976,Mary and I and our two small girls moved back home where I partnered with mybrother-in-law to build a grain elevator in my home county, which didn’t yet haveone. Sadly, he passed away in January of 1980 at the age of 43.I’ve been in agribusiness since 1977. I am the founder and operator of threeagribusiness and transportation firms serving farmers across the SoutheasternUnited States.Farming and farmers have been my life ever since. I have lived and breathed theexhilaration of a great crop and the despair and devastation of a drought. I learnedby experience what my father had told me as a child, “If you take care of the land,the land will take care of you”.Let’s fast forward to what you’re probably more interested in, my years as a publicservant. I want to be clear. Growing up, I wasn’t one of those 16-year-olds whoshook the hand of a president and was inspired to run for office. I was alwaystuned into current events, but I had no early interest in elected politics. I didunderstand we all have civic rent, so I agreed to chair our local planning andzoning commission.After 10 years, a State Senate seat became open and I was asked to run for the seat.I initially declined but a pre-planned family trip to Williamsburg, Virginia changedmy mind after observing the founder’s goals of citizen engagement.In 1990, the people of District 18 elected me to serve as a member of the GeorgiaState Senate. I served for 11 years and during my tenure, was elected by mycolleagues to be Senate President pro Tem, the pinnacle of leadership in that body,from 1996 until 1998. You’ve probably heard, and it’s interesting to note, that Iserved both as a Democrat and as a Republican while in the Georgia State Senate.In 2002, I was elected the first Republican Governor of Georgia in more than 130years. I assumed that office, believing that it was a big job, not a position. Ourteam worked diligently for eight years, striving to make Georgia the best managedstate in the nation. As you remember, the period from 2003 to 2011, were not thebest economic times for our nation. But, we learned, with the help of a joyful stateworkforce, we could continue to provide value to the citizens of Georgia, even intimes of extreme budget pressures.Even though Georgia may not compare to some of your states in some agriculturalsectors, I am still proud to come from a state whose number one economic driver isagriculture. In Georgia, agriculture is one area where Democrats and Republicansconsistently reached across the aisle and work together.It’s important to note that the makeup of this Committee speaks directly to the size,reach and diversity of America’s agricultural sector and that reaching across theaisle is common practice within this Committee, where partisanship doesn’t get inthe way of good solutions for American farmers, ranchers, and consumers. And tothat end, if confirmed as the Secretary of Agriculture, I look forward to workingwith you … each of you … to find solutions to the challenges confrontingAmerican Agriculture.Though I have a lifetime of experience with farming and agribusiness, I appreciatethat the Department of Agriculture touches the lives of all Americans in manyways that go beyond farming itself, including, in a small way, improving the livesof the “least of these”.As I answer your questions today, know that I approach this opportunity as I didwhen I was Governor. This is a big job with enormous responsibility, not just aposition. Whether it’s communicating a vision for USDA, managing competingpolicy priorities within the Department and Agencies, or influencing the Farm Billor budget discussions, I will dedicate my time as I said to each of you in ourpersonal meetings … through open, honest, and efficient communication.If I am honored with Senate confirmation, I will work tirelessly to advance fourprimary goals. And each of those goals is focused on an important constituency,the stakeholders of American agriculture.First, I will maximize the ability of the men and women of America’s agricultureand agribusiness sector to create jobs ... to produce and sell the foods and fiber thatfeed and clothe the world ... and to reap the earned reward of their labor. We wantto remove every obstacle, and give them every opportunity to prosper.Second, for the American taxpayers – our customers – I will prioritize customerservice every day. They expect, and have every right to demand, that we conductthe people’s business efficiently, effectively, and with the utmost integrity.Third, as our taxpayers are also consumers, they expect a safe and secure foodsupply and USDA will continue to serve in the critical role of ensuring the food weput on the table to feed our families meets the strict safety standards we’veestablished.I will never forget that we’re the fortunate beneficiaries of past generations, whoput a premium on smart stewardship, protecting, preserving, and entrusting us withthose valuable resources.And fourth … American agricultural bounty comes directly from the land. Andtoday, those land resources sustain more than 320 million Americans and countlessmillions more around the globe. My father’s words still ring in my ears, “Son, ifyou take care of the land, it will take care of you. Owned or rented, we’re allstewards, and our responsibility is to leave it better than we found it”.Should I be confirmed as Secretary of Agriculture, we will safeguard that trust,maintaining always our responsibility as good stewards. That means supportingprivate landowners in their conservation efforts ... and managing the naturalresources entrusted directly to the Department – including our National Forests –with sharp focus on renewability, sustainability, and most effective use. We willface the greatest challenges facing the agricultural industry and rural Americawhile collaborating to make opportunities for the future.Thank you for your time this morning. Rest assured that, if confirmed, I lookforward to working with you and the dedicated men and women of the USDA whoare committed to serving The People’s Department.I look forward to answering your questions."haley,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Senator Cardin, for your comments. And I certainlylook forward to discussing all of those things with you and the rest of the committee.I do have my family behind me because I've never been able to do anything without the support ofmy family. And so to my left, I have my favorite younger brother, Gogi Randhawa, who owns hisown business and is an entrepreneur. I have my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Randhawa, who remindedmy brothers, my sister and me every day how blessed we were to live in this country. I have myamazing husband, but also the coolest first man ever, but he is also a combat veteran, Michael isbehind me. And next to him is one of my pride and joy kids and that's Nalin who is wearing a suittoday, which he would prefer not wearing, but he does have his basketball shoes on. So I pick and choose my battles as a mom. I have in my in-laws, Bill and Carol Haley, who havebeen an amazing support to me and a second set of parents to us as we've gone through struggles.And then I have my favorite older brother, Mitti Randhawa, who is also a combat veteran, and hiswife, Sandra (ph). And then I have lots of friends behind them as well. And so I told them if Istarted to mess up, one of them needed to act like a protester. So we will see if that happens. I think she's going to do very well at the United Nations. So with that, I would like to say, Chairman Corker, Ranking Member Cardin, distinguishedmembers of the committee, I come before you today both humbled and honored to be consideredto represent the United States of America at the United Nations. Just as other nominees for thisposition have done, I'm here to outline my vision and discuss my qualifications.My story is an American story. I was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, the daughter of immigrantparents from Punjab, India. My parents had comfortable lives in India, but they chose to give upthose comforts and move to America with just $8 in their pockets, because of the freedoms andthe opportunities this country offers. Our family's experience is unique, but it is also familiarbecause it is one that has been repeated many times by many people in American history.Growing up in a small rural community in the South, our family was different. We were not whiteenough to be white, we were not black enough to be black. My father wore a turban, my motherwore a sari. Our new neighbors didn't quite know what to make of us, so we did face challenges,but those challenges paled next to the abundance of opportunities in front of us. My dad was a professor at a small historically black college, my mom was a social studies teacherand started a clothing store from scratch. I started doing the books for the family business when Iwas 13. It wasn't until I got to college that I realized that wasn't normal. But it was normal to me.In my family we worked.I was also privileged to take advantage of the educational opportunities that America affords. AndI am painfully aware that the chance for 13-year-old girls to read and learn and grow is somethingthat does not exist in far too many places around the world today.I went on to serve in South Carolina general assembly and to be elected and reelected governor ofthe palmetto state. Serving the people of South Carolina has been the greatest honor of my life.During the six years of my governorship, our state has faced many challenges, but South Carolinatoday is stronger economically and more united culturally than it has ever been before. And Icouldn't be more proud.While South Carolina will always be my home, I am eager to begin this new chapter. Internationaldiplomacy is a new area for me. There is much I am learning about the intricacies of the U.N. andits associated agencies. I don't claim that I know everything or that leadership at the U.N. is thesame as leading South Carolina. But diplomacy itself is not new to me. In fact, I would suggestthere is nothing more important to a governor's success than her ability to unite those with differentbackgrounds, viewpoints and objectives behind a common purpose. For six years that has been mywork, day after day, in times of celebration and in times of great tragedy.I have negotiated deals with some of the largest corporations in the world and convinced them tomake South Carolina their home. I have been the chief executive of a government with more than67,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $26 billion. And we have achieved realresults. South Carolina is a different, stronger, better place than it was six years ago.Like most government agencies, the United Nations could benefit from a fresh set of eyes. I willtake an outsider's look at the institution. As I have in every challenge in my life, I will come to theU.N. to work and to work smart.I will bring a firm message to the U.N. that U.S. leadership is essential in the world, it is essentialfor the advancement of humanitarian goals, and for the advancement of America's nationalinterests. When America fails to lead, the world becomes a dangerous place. And when the worldbecomes more dangerous, the American people become more vulnerable. At the U.N., aselsewhere, the United States is the indispensable voice of freedom. It is time that we once againfind that voice.The job of U.N. ambassador is different from being a governor, but there is one essential elementof leadership that is the same, and that is accountability. A leader must be accountable to the peopleshe serves. Should you confirm me as ambassador, I will be accountable, first and foremost to thepeople of the United States. Mr. Chairman, accountability means being honest with ourselves. As I appear before you today,when we look at the United Nations, we see a checkered history.The U.N. and its specialized agencies have had numerous successes. Its health and food programshave saved millions of lives. Its weapons monitoring efforts have provided us with vital securityinformation. Its peacekeeping missions have, at times, performed valuable services.However, any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with Americannational interests and American taxpayers.Nowhere has the U.N.'s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias againstour close ally Israel. In the General Assembly session just completed, the U.N. adopted 20resolutions against Israel and only six targeting the rest of the world's countries combined. In thepast 10 years, the Human Rights Council has passed 62 resolutions condemning the reasonableactions Israel takes to defend its security. Meanwhile the world's worst human rights abusers inSyria, Iran and North Korea received far fewer condemnations. This cannot continue.It is in this context that the events of December 23rd were so damaging. Last month's passage ofU.N. Resolution 2334 was a terrible mistake, making a peace agreement between the Israelis andthe Palestinians even harder to achieve. The mistake was compounded by the location in which ittook place, in light of the U.N.'s long history of anti-Israel bias.I was the first governor in America to sign legislation combating the anti-Israel Boycott, Divest,and Sanction, or the BDS movement. I will not go to New York and abstain when the U.N. seeksto create an international environment that encourages boycotts of Israel. In fact, I pledge to youthis: I will never abstain when the United Nations takes any action that comes in direct conflictwith the interests and values of the United States.In the matter of human rights, Mr. Chairman, whether it's the love of my family's and America'simmigrant heritage, or the removal of a painful symbol of an oppressive past in South Carolina, Ihave a clear understanding that it is not acceptable to stay silent when our values are challenged. Iwill be a strong voice for American principles and American interests, even if that is not whatother U.N. representatives want to hear. The time has come for American strength once again.There are other elements of accountability as well. As governor, the South Carolina constitutionrequired me to report annually to the people of my state on how their security and prosperity werebeing advanced by their government. In fact, I gave that State of the State address just one weekago. I was able to tell the citizens of South Carolina that we now invest more dollars in publiceducation than ever before, that our reserves have doubled while our debt service has been cut inhalf, and more South Carolinians are working today than ever in the history of our state.Without fundamental changes at the U.N., I cannot envision making the same kind of report to theAmerican people as their ambassador. We contribute 22 percent of the U.N.'s budget, far morethan any other country. We are a generous nation. But we must ask ourselves, what good is beingaccomplished by this disproportionate contribution? Are we getting what we pay for? To your credit, the Congress has already begun to explore ways the United States can use itsleverage to make the United Nations a better investment for the American people. I applaud yourefforts and I look forward to working with you to bring seriously needed change to the U.N. If I'mconfirmed, I will need you and I hope to have your support.In short, Mr. Chairman, my goal for the United Nations will be to create an international body thatbetter serves the interests of the American people.After the passage of the infamous U.N. resolution equating Zionism with racism in 1975, U.S.Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan came to the unsettling realization that, as he put it, quote,""If there were no General Assembly, this could never have happened.""Today, over 40 years later, more and more Americans are becoming convinced by actions like thepassage of Resolution 2334 that the United Nations does more harm than good. The Americanpeople see the U.N.'s mistreatment of Israel, its failure to prevent the North Korean nuclear threat,its waste and corruption, and they are fed up.My job -- our job -- is to reform the U.N. in ways that rebuild the confidence of the Americanpeople. We must build an international institution that honors America's commitment to freedom,democracy and human rights. I hope this can be done. I believe it is possible. And I know that ifyou confirm me, I will do all I can to see that that happens.Some say we live in cynical and distrustful times. But I believe we all carry in our hearts a bit ofidealism that animated the creation of the United Nations. I know I do. With your blessing, I willrepresent our great country in this international forum. I will do it in ways that I hope bring honorto our country, our values and our national interests.Thank you very much for your time."gina haspel,"Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner, members of the committee: Thank you for theopportunity to appear before you today. I am here because I have been nominated to lead theextraordinary men and women at the Central Intelligence Agency – men and women who are ourcountry’s silent warriors. These dedicated professionals spend much of their careers in difficult,far-flung outposts of the globe, striving to make our fellow Americans more secure at home. Ithas been the privilege of my professional life to be one of those CIA officers.Now, I have been asked by President Trump to lead this workforce and to continue the work thatMike Pompeo and I began a little more than a year ago: ensuring that CIA is postured to meet thecomplex challenges our nation faces. Those challenges include a changing but still lethal threatfrom terrorist groups; a nuclear threat against the continental United States from a rogue state;destabilizing Iranian adventurism; an aggressive and sometimes brutal Russia; and the long-termimplications of China’s ambitions on the global stage.While these challenges are daunting and offer few easy answers, I am confident the United Statesand the American people have the resolve to meet them head on. If I am confirmed as Director,you have my solemn commitment that I will position this Agency to provide the intelligencesupport our country needs to meet the challenges of today, and those of the future.I welcome the opportunity to introduce myself to the American people for the first time – it is anew experience for me as I spent over 30 years under cover and in the shadows. I don’t have anysocial media accounts, but otherwise I think you will find me to be a typical middle classAmerican – one with a strong sense of right and wrong and one who loves this country.I was born in Kentucky, and while my family has deep roots there, I was an Air Force “brat” andfollowed my father to postings all over the world. My childhood overseas instilled in me anappreciation for foreign languages and cultures, but also a deep understanding of the vital role ofAmerican leadership in confronting aggression abroad.I joined the CIA in 1985 as an operations officer in the Clandestine Service. From my first daysin training, I had a knack for the nuts and bolts of my profession. I excelled in finding andacquiring secret information that I obtained in brush passes, dead drops, or in meetings in dustyback allies of third world capitals. I recall my first foreign agent meeting was on a dark,moonless night with an agent I’d never met before. When I picked him up, he passed me theintelligence and I passed him extra money for the men he led. It was the beginning of anadventure I had only dreamed of.The men who ran CIA in those days leaned forward in giving me the right opportunities tosucceed or fail. When a very tough, old school leader announced that I was his pick to be Chief 2of Station in a small but important frontier post, a few competitors complained to me directly“why would they send you?” I owe that leader much for believing in me at a time when fewwomen were given these opportunities. While I could have done without the long nights,sleeping on the floor of my station, I was proud of the work we did there including the successfulcapture of two major terrorists, a counterproliferation operation that went our way, and thedismantlement of a local terrorist cell.Altogether, I have served seven tours in the field—four as Chief of Station—including hardshipassignments in distant posts and, more recently, in the capital of a major US ally.By any standard, my life at the Agency – and it has been my life – has exceeded all of myexpectations, from that January day when I took my oath to today. There were few senior womenleading at CIA in those days, and we are stronger now because that picture is changing. I did mypart – quietly and through hard work – to break down those barriers. And I was proud to be thefirst woman to serve as the number-two in the Clandestine Service. It is not my way to trumpetthe fact that I am a woman up for the top job, but I would be remiss in not remarking on it – notleast because of the outpouring of support from young women at CIA who consider it a goodsign for their own prospects.My experience and success as an operations officer led to three leadership positions in theClandestine Service, and one year ago, I was asked to serve as Deputy Director of CIA. Thereaction of the workforce to a rare nomination of one of their own to be Director – someone whohas been in the trenches with them – has been overwhelming. I am humbled by their confidencethat I can successfully lead this Agency and inspired to work harder than ever to maintain thatmutual trust.They know that I don’t need time to learn the business of what CIA does. I know CIA like theback of my hand. I know them, I know the threats we face, and I know what we need to besuccessful in our mission.I have played a leading role this past year in setting us on the right path and I intend oncontinuing on that path if I am confirmed as Director.Our strategy starts with strengthening our core business: collecting intelligence to helppolicymakers protect our country and advance American interests around the globe. It includesraising our investment against the most difficult intelligence gaps, putting more officers in theforeign field where our adversaries are, and emphasizing foreign language excellence. And,finally, it involves investing in our partnerships – both within the US Government and around theglobe.We must do everything we can to follow through on these investments and to make CIA aseffective as it can possibly be, because the American people deserve no less than CIA’s besteffort.This is especially true when it comes to confronting threats from North Korea, Iran, Russia, andChina. Today, CIA officers are deployed across the globe, sometimes at significant personal 3risk, collecting critical human and technical intelligence. I have spent my entire career drivingoperations and, if confirmed, I will be able to leverage that experience against these hard targetsbeginning on day one.I knew that accepting the president’s nomination would raise questions about CIA classifiedactivities and my career at the Agency. I also understand that it is important for the Americanpeople to get to know me so they are able to judge my fitness for this position. So over the lastfew weeks, we have leaned forward to make more information about my professional recordpublic. We have also shared details on every aspect of my career through classified channelswith this Committee, as well as with the rest of the Senate.I think it is important to recall the context of those challenging times immediately following9/11. For me, I had just returned to Washington from an overseas posting and I reported for dutythe morning of 9/11. I knew in my gut when I saw the video of the first plane hitting the Towerin Manhattan that it was Bin Ladin. I got up from my desk and, like many others, walked over tothe Counterterrorism Center and volunteered to help. I didn’t leave for three years. We workedseven days a week, and I even had friends who postponed weddings and having babies. The menand women of CIA were driven to prevent another attack. The first boots on the ground inAfghanistan were my colleagues. The first U.S. casualty in Afghanistan was a CIA officer and itwas CIA who identified and captured the mastermind of 9/11 in a brilliant operation. I am proudof our work during that time. The hard lessons we learned from that experience inform myleadership of CIA today.In light of my counterterrorism experience, I understand that what many people around thecountry want to know about are my views on CIA’s former detention and interrogation program.I have views on this issue, and I want to be clear. Having served in that tumultuous time, I canoffer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadershipCIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.CIA has learned some tough lessons, especially when asked to tackle missions that fall outsideour expertise. For me, there is no better example of implementing lessons learned than what theAgency took away from the detention and interrogation program. In retrospect it is clear, as theSSCI Majority Report concludes, that CIA was not prepared to conduct a detention andinterrogation program.Today, the US Government has a clear legal and policy framework that governs detentions andinterrogations. Specifically, the law provides that no individual in US custody may be subjectedto any interrogation technique or approach that is not authorized by and listed in the Army FieldManual. I fully support the standards for detainee treatment required by law, and just asimportantly, I will keep CIA focused on our collection and analysis missions that can bestleverage the expertise found at the Agency.Like I said, we learned important lessons following 9/11. As both a career intelligence officerand an American citizen, I am a strong believer in the importance of oversight. Simply put,experience has taught us that CIA cannot be effective without the people’s trust. And we cannothope to earn that trust without the accountability that comes with Congressional oversight.4If we can’t share aspects of our secret work with the public, we should do so with their electedrepresentatives. For CIA, oversight is a vital link to the open society we defend. It’s a definingfeature of the US Intelligence Community, and one of the many things that distinguishes us fromthe hostile services we face in the field.If confirmed as Director, I will uphold the Agency’s obligations to Congress and ensure thatoversight works on behalf of the American people.Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you and the Committee for the hard work that is put into theoversight process, and for the vital support that you provide to my fellow officers.CIA has given a lot to me over the past three decades—a calling in service to my country, somereal-life adventures, and the profound satisfaction of serving with some of the most talented andhonorable men and women anyone could ever meet.If confirmed, I hope to repay the debt I owe to this remarkable Agency by drawing on myexperience. I know what my fellow officers need from me and, I know what our nation needsfrom CIA—truth, integrity, and courage.Again, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to sit before you today, and I look forward toyour questions."mcmahon,"Thank you, Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the Committee. I'mhonored to have your consideration to serve as head of the U.S. Small BusinessAdministration. I'd like to thank Senator Blumenthal and Senator Murphy for their kindintroductions. I'd also like to express my gratitude to President Trump for this opportunity tojoin his Administration.As an entrepreneur myself, I have shared the experiences of our nation's small businessowners. We are more than our products and services. We are people. We are families. Thesmall businesses that are the engine of our national economy are driven in part by peopleworking to put food on the table, pay for kids' braces and swimming lessons, save for collegeand prepare for their own retirement. Whether it's an organic farmer or an app developer,with one employee or a hundred, we can never forget that small businesses are people withgoals and values that cannot be calculated just on a profit-and-loss statement. If I have thehonor of being confirmed as the head of the SBA, I will do my best to advocate on theirbehalf.My husband and I built our business from scratch. We started out sharing a desk. Over decades of hard work and strategic growth, we built it into a publicly traded global enterprisewith more than 800 employees. I am proud of our success - I know every bit of the hard workit took to create that success. I remember the early days when every month I had to decidewhether I should continue to lease a typewriter or if I could finally afford to buy it. Yes, that$12 a month really made a difference in our budget.Uke all small business owners, I know what it's like to take a risk on an idea, manage cashflow, navigate regulations and tax laws, and create jobs. Since stepping down as CEO of WWEin 2009, I have worked to help more people have the opportunity to pursue those goals.In my travels throughout Connecticut in 2010 and 2012, I met with more than 500 smallbusiness owners - touring their shops, restaurants, offices and factories and sharing ideasduring roundtable discussions. Job growth was a pillar of my campaign, and because smallbusinesses are responsible for half of all private-sector jobs and the majority of new jobs,they were my focus.And for the past two years, I have promoted women in entrepreneurship as co-founder andCEO of a startup called Women's Leadership LIVE. I wanted to share my vast experience withothers who are launching startups or looking to scale their businesses. Through live eventsand webinars, we educate entrepreneurs about things like applying for a loan and developinga business plan. We also work to build their confidence. I always say that even entrepreneurs with the best ideas sometimes need a little wind beneath their wings. Women's leadershipLIVE hopes that by sharing our stories of successes and failures, our networks of contacts andresources, and our strategies for addressing challenges, we can give small business ownersthe confidence that will help propel them forward.Small business owners do not just need confidence in themselves; in order to take a risk, theyneed confidence in the economy. Should I have the honor of being confirmed to lead the SBA,I will work to revitalize a spirit of entrepreneurship in America. Small businesses want to feelthey can take a risk on an expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulationsor unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable. We want torenew optimism in our economy.Small businesses have had some tough blows in the past decade. I know what it's like to takea hit, and I have learned it's not how you fall, but how you get up that truly matters. Early inmy career, when we were very young, my husband and I declared bankruptcy. We invested ina company we didn't understand and trusted people we shouldn't have. When that companywent under, we were left holding the bag. We worked really hard to pay off those debts untilwe realized we just couldn't. Bankruptcy was a really hard decision and a tough time in ourlives. We lost our home. My car was repossessed in the driveway. We had a young son and ababy on the way. We had no choice but to work hard and start building again so we couldsupport our family. When our daughter Stephanie was born - a perfect little baby so full of promise and potential-! took it as an omen that things were going to be okay. We owed it toher and to our son that we would make it okay. And fortunately, we did.As I visited small businesses all over the country through Women's leadership LIVE, I haveseen that same resiliency over and over again. Entrepreneurs are fighters. They work hard,and when they get knocked down by a recession or a natural disaster or simply a change inconsumer demand, they turn to their creativity to make it better. But sometimes they need ahelping hand. If I am honored to be confirmed, I will work to guide SBA as that helping handin the most efficient and effective way possible.I believe in leadership by example. As a CEO, I never expect employees to do anything I amnot willing to do myself. I believe in setting expectations and holding people accountable, buttrusting them to do the job for which they were hired. If confirmed, I look forward to workingwith the SBA staff. I am eager to learn from their experience and expertise. I will listen, andtheir ideas, concerns and recommendations will be taken seriously. I know there will be newchallenges in a government setting, but I will commit myself with the same responsibility todeliver value to the taxpayers of America as I did to the shareholders of my company.Over the past two weeks I have had the pleasure of meeting with many members of theCommittee, and I appreciate the kind words of encouragement I have received. Thank you forthe opportunity to speak with you today. I am happy to take your questions.  "coats,"Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner, Members of the Committee – I am honored to appearbefore you as the nominee for the position of Director of National Intelligence. It was a greatprivilege of mine to have served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and to see upclose the great work done by all of the Members and staff.I’ll admit, however, the view is a little bit different down here than it was up there.I’d like to begin by thanking President Trump for nominating me for the position of Director ofNational Intelligence – I am humbled by his confidence in me, and will work tirelessly to leadthe world’s finest intelligence enterprise.I would also like to thank Vice President Pence, my Indiana colleague and someone I’m honoredto call my friend, for his support. I’m proud to have worked with him for so long, and deeplyappreciate his faith in me.Senator Chambliss, thank you for being here to introduce me today. We served together in theSenate, and I particularly enjoyed working alongside you in your leadership role of thisCommittee. I’m honored by your kind introduction and presence here today, and for thefriendship you and your wife, Julianne, have provided to my wife, Marsha, and me over the years– Saxby, thank you.I’d also like to acknowledge the work of the previous DNI, Jim Clapper, and his PrincipalDeputy, Stephanie O’Sullivan. Their stewardship of the Intelligence Community over the pastyears has been commendable, and their guidance in helping me prepare for this position has beeninvaluable. They left in place an experienced and great team who have been instrumental inproviding a smooth transition for the ODNI and the IC.Also, I want to recognize my fellow Hoosiers who elected me to the House and Senate over thepast years. I have always done my best to represent them, and am honored by the confidencethey put in me time and again.While I’ll always be a Hoosier at heart, if confirmed as the next Director of NationalIntelligence, I will represent the dedicated men and women of the ODNI and the broader IC tothe best of my ability. 2Finally, and saving the best for last, I would like to thank my wife Marsha and children Laura,Lisa, and Andrew. Together my three children have produced 10 perfect grandchildren. Mycareer in public service is a direct reflection of their enduring support and love. Without theirencouragement, I wouldn’t be sitting before you today.It has been a long road of public service that has brought me here before you. After 34 years ofservice in the House, Senate, and as US Ambassador to Germany, I was ready to make atransition and planned to move on to a new chapter of my lifelong journey back home again inIndiana.But as I have learned over those 34 years, life doesn’t always work out that way. When calledupon to consider this position, I first consulted my most important advisor – my wife, Marsha –as I examined the responsibilities of such a significant Office. As a former teacher and familytherapist, Marsha understands me and the importance of public service. She is the rock thatprovides stability and wise counsel, shoulder to shoulder with me in every aspect of my life.While I am no longer retiring from public service, what I AM retiring is my policy hat – a hat Iwore proudly for years as I represented the views of my constituents, offered policy proposals,and cast votes in Committee and on the floor.Just as this government transitions to new leadership, I too hope to transition to the role ofprincipal intelligence advisor to the President.In this new role, it will be my responsibility to present the President, senior policymakersthroughout the Administration, and you the Congress, with the best and most objective, nonpolitical,and timely intelligence as you consider policies and the future of our great Nation.The President and I have discussed my potential role as his principal intelligence advisor, and weboth recognize that this position is frequently the bearer of unpleasant news. But if confirmed,my responsibility would be to provide him with the most accurate and objective intelligencepossible.In my various conversations with many of you prior to this hearing, I was asked about how I seemy role as the DNI. Those that know me know that I’m an avid sports fan—never more avidthan this past year as I celebrated the seemingly impossible accomplishment of the Chicago Cubswinning the World Series.So allow me to compare how I see my role as the DNI using, well not a baseball but rather afootball analogy.On a football team, the players are guided by a variety of coaches. There’s a coach for theoffense, one for the defense, one for special teams, one each for offensive and defensive linemen,one for quarterbacks, and several others. 3But every team has a head coach – that leader who walks the sidelines and, while not dictating toeach coach how to do their specific job, pulls each of those specialists together to form aseamless and focused team.I see the role of the Director of National Intelligence as analogous to this head coach role for theIntelligence Community – integrating the IC and leveraging all of the expertise in ourCommunity.We have immense talent resident in the many agencies across the IC, and each one contributesunique capabilities or expertise that is necessary for the team as a whole to be successful._ The unique access of our human intelligence sources and the detailed analysis from theCentral Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency;_ The signals intelligence expertise of the National Security Agency is second to none;_ The geospatial mastery demonstrated by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency;_ The acquisition proficiency of our satellite specialists at the National ReconnaissanceOffice;_ The force multiplier the intelligence elements of the Armed Services bring to this teameffort;_ The domestic counterterrorism and counterintelligence work done by the Federal Bureauof Investigation;_ And the specialized skills of the IC elements resident within the Departments of State,Treasury, Justice, Homeland Security, and Energy.Like a head coach, I see it as my job to pull all of these team members together under the samegame plan to produce the best coordinated and integrated intelligence. To make the wholegreater than the sum of the parts.Given the complicated threat environment that we face today in this country and around theworld, now more than ever, the IC must work as a team. Seamless.The threats that we face today are more challenging, dynamic, and geographically diffuse thanever before. Allow me to address, in no particular order, what I see as some of the mostchallenging issues we currently face:_ Clearly the rising cyber threat must be highlighted. Cyberspace is both a resource and aliability; an increasingly connected world creates tremendous opportunities, but alsomany vulnerabilities._ Not unrelated, I would also highlight the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, whichcontinues to be a significant threat to the United States and its allies abroad. They’respreading their message of fear and hate through cyber space, and mobilizing to venuesbeyond their self-described caliphate.4_ China’s continued regional activism, including its disputed territorial claims in the Eastand South China Seas, is troubling, and will be a long-term challenge._ Russia’s assertiveness in global affairs is something I look upon with great concern,which we need to address with eyes wide open and a healthy degree of skepticism._ And North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and, quite frankly, provocations, are something theintelligence community needs to be laser-focused on.The list continues with a diverse set of challenges—including those in Iran, Syria, Afghanistan,and other hot spots around the world.In order to address these threats, I will bring my many years of experience in how to execute on aplan, and bring together teams of people toward a common goal.As Ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005, I oversaw the activity of nearly two dozenagencies at the American embassy.I trust that my experiences coordinating and integrating that many different departments andagencies, overseeing their activities, leveraging their strengths, and bringing them together undera single strategy will serve me well as DNI.As a Member of Congress in both the House and Senate, I have always had a keen interest inensuring we are responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.In evaluating federal programs, I always made a point to ask questions about what works, whatdoesn’t work, and why. I also believed it was important to assess how we establish priorities.We must ask ourselves: in a time of tightened budgets, what programs are truly essential, andwhich may no longer be necessary, or of lower priority? How does each program support ouroverall goal or strategy? And is it duplicative of another effort?I will be looking to ask the IC these and many more questions if confirmed as the DNI.And in the vein of efficiency, there has been much discussion about the role of the DNI, and theOffice of the DNI. Let me share with you what I have learned in preparation for thisopportunity.Over the past 12 years since its inception, the ODNI has been tasked with a variety ofresponsibilities – in statute, in Executive Orders, and in Presidential Memoranda, along withrecommendations coming from the 9/11 Commission and Silberman/Robb Commission onWeapons of Mass Destruction.The people supporting these directives are hardworking folks from all across the IC. Of note, asignificant portion of the ODNI’s workforce is on rotation from other IC agencies.ODNI was established to counter the pre-9/11 stove-piping by individual intelligence agencies,and ensure collaboration and integration across the intelligence elements.5ODNI brings together talent from across the Community to integrate intelligence and does itsbest to connect all dots – not just specific dots from specific agencies and specialties.In keeping with my earlier football analogy, you can’t play a complete game with just a starquarterback and wide receiver—well maybe the New England Patriots can. But even the Patsneed a strong offensive line, a stout defense, agile special teams, and a talented place kicker –along with many other players.Not every player on a football team is going to be the MVP, but they are a team nonetheless, andeveryone on the field plays a critical role. And when we win, we win as a team.I’ve also been asked about the size of the Office of the DNI, and whether it’s too large.As I looked at the many requirements of the Office reflected in various laws, orders, andrecommendations, I’ve been impressed by the Office’s responsiveness to these many taskswithin reasonable resources.Recent commentary on the size of the ODNI doesn’t mesh well with what I’ve seen first-hand,and I believe it does a disservice to this committee and your efforts to keep the size of the ODNIin check.That said, and as I discussed earlier, I believe every government agency must constantly reviewits operations, and I’ll be taking a look at not only the Office of the DNI, but the entire IC, and athow we can do things most efficiently and effectively.Much has been made publicly about the role of our Intelligence enterprise, and how it will fare inthe future. And I am encouraged by what I see. With the leadership team in place at the ICagencies, I know that this Community will continue as the world class intelligence enterprise thatit is today.Before going to questions, I’d like to share with you the early goals that, if confirmed, I willshare with the IC.I intend to push the IC to be the best it can be, and not accept the status quo when it comes to thechallenges facing our nation.I intend to ask the IC to be innovative in its approach to hard problems and the solutions to solvethem.I intend to be a champion for the hardworking men and women of the IC – to be there for themthe way they are here for all of us. Every day, the men and women of the IC are workingtirelessly on the front lines – often times in shadows, often times in very dangerous situations –with the common goal of keeping America safe and secure. 6I also intend to work with all of you to ensure that the IC has the support it needs to tacklewhatever the opposing teams bring our way, and to ensure that the Congress and this Committeehave access to the information they need to conduct their oversight responsibilities.I am honored by the opportunity to be here with you today, and I thank you for yourconsideration of my nomination. And with that, I look forward to answering your questions. "wilbur ross,"Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Nelson, and members of the Committee, thank you for theopportunity to appear before you today. As a proud resident of Florida I am honored bythe presence of both of my home State Senators, and I would also like to thank SenatorMarco Rubio for his kind introduction.With me today is my wife, Hilary Geary Ross.Since President-elect Trump announced my nomination, I’ve had the opportunity to meetwith many of you. In our meetings, I’ve heard firsthand how we can work together onbehalf of the American people. These meetings have been helpful to me. I look forward toour continued dialog.Mr. Chairman, I am honored to be under consideration for Secretary of the United StatesDepartment of Commerce. I’m particularly interested in the Department of Commerce forseveral reasons.First, I may be the only nominee for Secretary of Commerce that was a U.S. Census Taker. Iwas working my way through Harvard Business School and that was one of the jobs that Ihad during college. At that time, we would put on the big white sash along with a badgeand we would visit individual homes and record information for the Census. I was assignedto Scollay Square in Boston. We had to convince people through a small opening of thedoor that we were helping record an accurate count. So I have some personal experiencewith the Census – a very important function within the Department of Commerce.Second, like many other business people across the United States, I have been a consumerof the data and information the Department provides a periodic basis. Data theDepartment gathers and makes public, such as the Census data, the data that the BEA putsout and NOAA’s reports, to name a few, are essential functions. I believe there is greaterpotential in the breadth and the depth of the data the Department provides to encouragenew investment.2Third, in terms of telecommunications, the Department auctions spectrum and helps bringaccess to broadband to communities nationwide. In some small way I have directexperience with broadband deployment. Before this nomination, I was the vice chair of theUtilities Undergrounding Task Force where I live in Southern Florida. The Task Force iseager to move to fiber optics and telecommunications to our community. In order to do sothe Task Force had to do it in way that was not damaging to the Everglades.That brings me to NOAA. Living on the coast in Southern Florida, we are all very sensitiveto weather because of the yearly hurricane season. So weather information is critical to us,like so many communities across the United States. I am also well aware of the importanceof the fishing industry and tourism to coastal economies, so I am looking forward to theindividual issues on those matters that fall within the jurisdiction of the Department ofCommerce.And then there is trade. I’ve made my livelihood for over five decades dealing ininternational commerce. My companies have operated on the ground in some 23 countriesaround the world. Sometimes those operations have progressed happily, sometimes a lotless happily.I’ve also been in the middle of complicated situations in our domestic manufacturing sectorand being subjected to some of the bad trade activities of other countries, both in terms ofnon-tariff trade barriers that some countries impose on us and state subsidies of foreignexports coming into the United States. I think I’ve probably had more direct experiencethan any prior Cabinet nominee has had with unfair trade in the steel business, in thetextile business, in the auto parts business and other sectors. I am very well aware of theissues many companies face and I’m sensitive to both the issues abroad and the issues hereat home.While I have worked with many people across many lands, the thing I’m proudest about inmy whole career is working with Leo Gerard, the President of the United Steel Workers ofAmerica, and other unions in saving the American steel industry. Working together wewere able to save thousands of jobs and ensure this important industry continued in theUnited States.I also understand that at the end of the day, each of our trading partners want access to ourmarket. The United States should provide that access to nations who agree to play by our 3standards of fair trade. We should not put up with malicious trading activities, state ownedenterprises, or subsidized production.So I am not anti-trade. I am pro trade. But I am pro sensible trade, not trade that isdetrimental to the American worker and to the domestic manufacturing base.During these past few weeks, President-elect Trump has met with many business leadersfrom across many industries. I have attended many of the meetings. One of the meetingswas with leaders from the tech industry. I was amazed how similar the problems they arefacing, both in terms of trying to compete in foreign jurisdictions and competition comingin from abroad, are to the problems faced by more traditional industries like steel andtextiles. The techniques and products of the tech industry are different but the nature ofthe adverse trade activities they face are very similar to those experienced by theindustries I’ve worked in for many years.The Department serves many more functions, and I very much look forward to helping theAmerican entrepreneur, the American worker, and American companies both big and smalldrive this economy forward and to create jobs.I want to thank my wife for supporting my decision to enter public service, and to thankyou once again for the opportunity to be here in front of this Committee. If confirmed Ilook forward to working with you and with the many dedicated public servants at theDepartment of Commerce.I look forward to your questions."mattis,"Thank you Mr. Chairman. It is an honor to come before you for this confirmation hearingas the President-elect’s nominee for the position of Secretary of Defense.I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Reed, and the members of thiscommittee for taking time to see me during my courtesy calls – and I thank you for yourwillingness to accommodate this hearing and consider my nomination. I have testifiedpreviously in front of this committee and I have always held it in the highest regard.I wish to thank former Senator William Cohen for so kindly introducing me this morning.I’m grateful to the long-serving former chairman of this committee, Senator Sam Nunn,for his strong support.It is humbling to be considered for this position, and I thank the President-elect forplacing his trust and confidence in me.I did not anticipate this request. When the call came from New York, I had a full life westof the Rockies. I was not involved in the presidential campaign and I was certainly notseeking or envisioning a position in any new administration. I relished my military careerbut never imagined further government service.That said, it would be my highest honor, if I am confirmed, to lead those who volunteerto defend our country. Military service is a touchstone for American patriots of all races,genders, and creeds. The men and women of the Department of Defense – military andcivilian – reflect the diverse, non-partisan, and selfless character of our nationaldefense. They do their duty, and they honor all the previous generations of veteransand civil servants who have served and sacrificed for our country. And they return toprivate life as better citizens and even more grateful for what America represents in thisworld.I know the Senators of this committee are well aware of the many global securitychallenges we face. We see each day a world awash in change; our country is still atwar in Afghanistan and our troops are fighting against ISIS and other terrorist groups inthe Middle East and elsewhere. Russia is raising grave concerns on several fronts andChina is shredding trust along its periphery. Increasingly, we see islands of stability inour hemisphere, in Europe, and in Asia under attack by non-state actors and nationsthat mistakenly see their security in the insecurity of others.We find ourselves embracing the dual reality of seeking engagement and cooperationwhere we can, yet defending our interests where we must. While our military maintainscapable land, air, and sea forces, the cyber and space domains now demand anincreasing share of our attention and investment. These realities represent the prominent challenges facing our military and the gravity of my leadership task if youchoose to confirm me.Our Armed Forces must remain the best led, best equipped, and most ready force in theworld. There is no room for complacency and we have no God-given right to victory onthe battlefield. The reset of our force has been inadequate: our military gear is heavilyused and it has not been properly and fully reconstituted following 15 years ofdeployment and conflict. Maintenance has been insufficient: if we do not maintain ourgear, the money we spend on acquisition is wasted and we will have a hollow force.Future readiness is achieved through modernization, and that too has languished and ispaying the price of sequestration.These demanding times require us to put together a strong national security team herein Washington and to work closely with our allies. If confirmed, I will lead theDepartment of Defense and be a forthright member of that team. I will be an advocatefor our military, which is the envy of the world and represents America’s awesomedetermination to defend herself; I will be an advocate for the President-elect’s vision of astrengthened national security stance; and I recognize that I will need to be thestrongest possible advocate for military and civilian personnel and their families, as wework to keep alive our experiment in democracy.If confirmed, I will foster an atmosphere of harmony and trust at the Department ofDefense and with our interagency counterparts. The defense of our country is neitherpartisan nor personal, rather it is collaborative; vigorous debate in private is to beexpected, and the process of sorting out competing views is often untidy yet necessaryto craft ultimately a coherent strategy with bipartisan support and cooperation acrossthe government and with our allies.We must integrate our global and regional strategies so that our response to eachimmediate, vexing issue does not plant the seed of a new, more dangerous problem. Asswiftly as the President-elect’s national security team is confirmed, I will work to makesure the strategy and military calculus are employed so that we reinforce traditionaltools of diplomacy, ensuring our President and our diplomats negotiate from a positionof strength. Our recent experiences have reminded us that we should engage moreusing all components of our national power, and use military force only when it is in thevital interest of the United States, when other elements of national power have beeninsufficient in protecting our national interests, and generally as a last resort.In addition to ensuring collaboration across government and the adoption of anintegrated strategy, we must also embrace our international alliances and securitypartnerships. History is clear: nations with strong allies thrive and those without themwither.Strengthening our alliances requires finding common cause, even with imperfectpartners; taking no ally for granted; and living up to our treaty obligations. WhenAmerica gives its word, it must mean what it says. We must also promote and enlistcommensurate support from all our allies. The American taxpayer should not carry adisproportionate part of our shared defense, and all who benefit should be expected tohelp carry their part of the burden.If confirmed, my watchwords will be solvency and security in providing for the protectionof our people and the survival of our freedoms. My priorities as Secretary of Defensewill be to strengthen military readiness, principally by increasing the lethality of theforce; to strengthen our alliances in league with our diplomatic partners by collaboratingwith allies whenever and wherever possible; and to bring business reforms to theDepartment of Defense by instilling budget discipline and holding our leadersaccountable. All personnel policies will be designed to bring troops home alive andvictorious. I will be committed to earning the trust and confidence of the Congress – andthe American people – that the Department is the best possible steward of taxpayermoney.The Department must now look across components and organizations to inform astrategic and realistic plan of potential reforms. It is imperative to disaggregate functionsthat add value, including those that increase the lethality of the force and help theDepartment achieve its aims, from functions that are duplicative and unnecessary.If confirmed, I will support the President-elect’s stated aim and work in concert withcongressional leaders to invest in defense and remove the practice known assequestration. I strongly support the Congress working to restore its active oversightrole instead of continuing to rely on the non-strategic and self-destructive cuts imposedby sequestration.Working with Congress I will endeavor to keep our unique All-Volunteer Force secondto-none.We need to open the door to all who are eligible and wish to serve; providethem with the training, equipment, and confidence that are essential to their success;and ensure all service members are treated with dignity and respect.Our leaders at all levels of the chain of command will be accountable to ensure thateach member of the Armed Forces has the opportunity to excel in an environment thatmaximizes their talents and has no patience for those who would degrade or diminishany person’s service.Today over 15 percent of today’s active-duty force is female. Our military could notaccomplish its missions without these women. As we ask more from our female enlistedmembers and officers, we owe them more as well.The rate of sexual assault and harassment in the military is not acceptable. If I amconfirmed, I will continue the Department’s focus on sexual assault prevention andresponse, and I will work with the committee to deal with this problem more effectively.The Department must do more to ensure service members can report any crime,including a crime involving sexual assault, without any fear of retaliation.Any organization needs to get its strategic vision right, and if I am confirmed, mystrategic aim will be three-pronged: we will first maintain a safe and secure nucleardeterrent – because we must ensure a war that can never be won will never be fought.Second, we will field a decisive conventional force – because as expensive as it is tosustain such a force, it is far less costly in lives and treasure than a conventional warthat we are unable to deter because we are seen as weak. Third, we will retain irregularwarfare as a core competency of our Armed Forces – to ensure we can fight across thefull spectrum of war. We will compose our forces accordingly.I recognize my potential civilian role differs in essence and in substance from my formerrole in uniform. While serving in uniform I obeyed civilian leadership whiledemonstrating loyalty to the U.S. Constitution. In addition to my combat, joint, andNATO roles while in uniform, I served as the Executive Secretary to Secretaries ofDefense Bill Perry and Bill Cohen in the mid-to-late-1990s and Senior Military Assistantto Deputy Secretaries of Defense Rudy de Leon and Paul Wolfowitz before 9/11. Thoseassignments allowed me to observe and support the civilian decision-making process atthe most senior levels of the Department.Civilian control of the military is a fundamental tenet of the American military tradition.From day one service members swear an oath to support and defend the U.S.Constitution; they see photos of the nation’s civilian leaders prominently displayedabove their uniformed leadership; and they are imbued with the principle that ournation’s elected and appointed leaders control the use of our military. It is a hallmark ofAmerica’s military that service members take pride in our country’s adherence to thatprinciple, and it is a hallmark espoused by every U.S. military leader I have observed.The President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief and he alone isaccountable to the American people for the outcomes of our integrated diplomatic,economic, and security decisions. The Secretary of Defense is the principal assistant tothe President in all matters related to the Department of Defense. Both the Commanderin-Chiefand the Secretary of Defense must impose an objective strategic calculus in thenational security decision-making process and effectively direct its activities. They mustensure our nation takes the grave step of using force only when other non-militarymeans have failed; when a defined and achievable political end-state is determined;and when our nation commits full resources to the fight.Civilian leaders bear these responsibilities because the esprit-de-corps of our military,its can-do spirit, and its obedience to civilian leadership reduces the inclination andpower of the military to criticize or oppose the policy it is ultimately ordered toimplement. If I am confirmed, the President-elect and his national security team willreceive my full support, and the support of the Department of Defense, in theformulation of policy and the development of military options to implement that policy.If the Senate consents and if the full Congress passes an exception to the seven-yearrequirement, I will provide strong civilian leadership of military plans and decisions. I willinsist unfiltered military advice is presented in full. And I will hold senior military and civilian leaders accountable for performance. I know what to expect from uniformedleadership in interactions with the Department’s civilian leadership.I recognize under the Constitution it is the Congress that raises, sustains, and supportsour Armed Forces through annual authorizations and appropriations. For many years Ihave watched you in action and testified before you and I look forward to collaboratingclosely for the defense of our nation.Having been nominated for this position, I am mindful of the extraordinary privilege it isto serve alongside so many service members and civilians of the Department ofDefense. I will hold them and their families foremost in my thoughts and work to givethem the best chance for victory if you confirm me.Finally, on a personal note, I have worked at the Pentagon twice in my career. But fewpeople may know I am not the first person in my family to do so. When, in the wartimespring of 1942, my mother was 20 years old and working in military intelligence, shewas part of the first wave of government employees to move into the still-unfinishedPentagon. She had come to America as an infant and lives today on the banks of theColumbia River in the Pacific Northwest. Little could she imagine in her youth that morethan 90 years after she immigrated to this country, and 75 years after she first walkedthrough the doors of the War Department, one of her sons would be sitting here todaybefore the Senate. "sessions,"Thank you Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner for allowing me to publicly appear before the committee today.I appreciate the Committee's critically important efforts to investigate Russian interference with our democratic process. Such interference can never be tolerated and I encourage every effort to get to the bottom of any such allegations.As you know, the Deputy Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate matters related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. I am here today to address several issues that have been specifically raised before this committee, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to questions as fully as I am able to do so. But as I advised you, Mr. Chairman, and consistent with long-standing Department of Justice practice, I cannot and will not violate my duty to protect confidential communications with the President.Now, let me address some issues directly: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. I did not attend any meetings at that event. Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump. Though I do recall several conversations I had during that pre-speech reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials. If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it. After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel.But whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns. Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign. I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie.Relatedly, there is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Franken's question honestly at my confirmation hearing. That is false. This is how it happened. He asked me a rambling question that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community had advised President-elect Trump that ""there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government."" I was taken aback by these explosive allegations, which he said were being reported in breaking news that day. I wanted to refute immediately any suggestion that I was a part of such an activity. I replied, ""Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have -- did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.""That was the context in which I was asked the question, and in that context, my answer was a fair and correct response to the charge as I understood it. It simply did not occur to me to go further than the context of the question and list any conversations I may have had with Russians in routine situations, as I had with numerous other foreign officials.Please hear me now. It was only in March of this year that a reporter asked my spokesperson whether I had ever met with any Russian officials. This was the first time that question had been posed. On the same day, we provided that reporter with the information related to the meeting I and my staff had held in my Senate office with Ambassador Kislyak, as well as the brief encounter in July after a speech that I had given during the convention in Cleveland, Ohio. I also provided the reporter a list of all 25 foreign ambassador meetings I had held during 2016. In addition, I provided supplemental testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain this. I readily acknowledged these two meetings. Certainly nothing improper occurred.Let me also explain clearly the circumstances of my recusal from the investigation into the Russian interference with the 2016 election. I was sworn in as Attorney General on Thursday, February 9th. The very next day, I met with career Department officials, including a senior ethics official, to discuss some things publicly reported in the press and that might have some bearing on the issue of recusal. From that point, February 10th, until I announced my formal recusal on March 2nd, I was never briefed on any investigative details and did not access information about the investigation; I received only the limited information that the Department's career officials determined was necessary to inform my recusal decision. As such, I have no knowledge about this investigation beyond what has been publicly reported, and I have taken no action with regard to any such investigation. On the date of my formal recusal, my Chief of Staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to Director Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters. And in fact, they have not. Importantly, I recused myself not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign, but because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45.2, required it. That regulation states, in effect, that Department employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign advisor.The scope of my recusal, however, does not and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35,000 employees. I presented to the President my concerns, and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr. Comey along with the Deputy Attorney General's memorandum, which have been released publicly by the White House. It is a clear statement of my views. It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render an Attorney General unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.Finally, during his testimony, Mr. Comey discussed a conversation he and I had about a meeting Mr. Comey had with the President. I am happy to share with the committee my recollection of the conversation I had with Mr. Comey. Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr. Comey spoke to me and my Chief of Staff. While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the President, Mr. Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the President. I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow Department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House. Mr. Comey had served in the Department of Justice for the better part of two decades, and I was confident that Mr. Comey understood and would abide by the Department's well-established rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations. My comments encouraged him to do just that and indeed, as I understand, he did. Our Department of Justice rules on proper communication between the Department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them, I thought, and assumed correctly that he complied with them.I will finish with this. I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations. At all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming Attorney General, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards.The people of this country expect an honest and transparent government and that is what we are giving them. This President wants to focus on the people of this country to ensure they are treated fairly and kept safe. The Trump agenda is to improve the lives of the American people. I know some have other agendas, but that is his agenda and it is one I share.Importantly, as Attorney General I have a responsibility to enforce the laws of this Nation, to protect this country from its enemies, and to ensure the fair administration of justice. I intend to work every day with our fine team and the superb professionals in the Department of Justice to advance the important work we have to do. These false attacks, the innuendo, and the leaks, you can be sure, will not intimidate me. In fact, these events have only strengthened my resolve to fulfill my duty to reduce crime, and to support our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who work our streets every day. Just last week, it was reported that overdose deaths in this country are rising faster than ever recorded. The murder rate is up over 10 percent—the largest increase since 1968. Together, we are telling the gangs, the cartels, the fraudsters, and the terrorists—we are coming after you. Every one of our citizens, no matter who they are or where they live, has the right to be safe in their homes and communities. And I will not be deterred, and I will not allow this great Department to be deterred from its vital mission."mulvaney,"Thank you, Chairman Enzi, Ranking Member Sanders, and members of theCommittee for welcoming me today. It is an honor and a privilege to be here. I ampleased to present my qualifications and my vision for the Office of Managementand Budget to this committee.Thank you to the President for nominating me, and for the confidence he showedin me by doing so.Thank you to Senator Graham and Senator Cotton for your kind remarks.Thank you especially to my family. As the members of this committee know betterthan most, the burdens of public service often fall on our families. I deeplyappreciate their continued support. We don’t get an opportunity to say this nearlyenough, and almost never on national television, but I am very proud of the youngadults my children have become, despite the fact – or maybe because of the fact? –that their dad has been away from home for much of the past several years. Andthat is a testament to the kind of woman my wife is. I am extraordinarily proud,and happy, to have her in my life.Finally, I am grateful for the members of the Committee and their staff, not onlyfor having me here today, but also for taking the time to meet with me over the lastfew weeks and sharing your views. Should I be confirmed, I look forward tocontinuing our conversations, and to getting your guidance and wisdom.Because no one can do this job alone. Perhaps a member of Congress knows thatbetter than most. Several former members of Congress have served at OMB –Senator Portman, Jim Nussle, Leon Panetta – they all served with distinction, set ahigh bar, and provided a good example of how the OMB director should interactwith and serve the President, Congress, and the American people.If confirmed, I will use them as models. You deserve the truth, as do the Americanpeople, and it is the OMB Director’s responsibility to tell you – and the President –the truth, even when that might be hard to hear.For the first time in America’s history, the next generation could be lessprosperous than the generation that preceded it. To me, and to the people in thisroom, that is simply unacceptable. We CAN turn this economy, and this countryaround…but it will take tough decisions today in order to avoid impossible onestomorrow.Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion. That number is solarge as to defy description. I choose to look at it another way: to an ordinaryAmerican family, that translates to a credit card bill of $260,000. Families knowwhat that would mean for them. It is time for government to learn the same lesson.I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressedsooner, rather than later. I also know that fundamental changes are needed in theway Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. This mustinclude changing our government’s long-term fiscal path – which is unsustainable.Part of fixing that problem also means taking a hard look at governmentwaste…and then ending it. American taxpayers deserve a government that isefficient, effective, and accountable. American families earn their money honestly;they expect the government to spend it honestly. We owe them that much.But fixing the economy doesn’t mean just taking a green eyeshade approach to thebudget. Our government isn’t just about numbers. A strong, healthy economyallows us to protect our most vulnerable. My mother-in-law relied on socialsecurity when she retired; she relied on Medicare to see to her medical needsbefore she died of cancer. Pam and I were glad that the safety net was there for her.We would also like it to be there for her grandchildren, our triplets, as well.All of that being said, I know many of the members of this committee will want toknow what my positions will be as OMB Director. I am, of course, not yet in thatposition, and I do not presume to know about decisions I might make, much lesswhat decisions the President might make after consulting his cabinet and advisors.I do know what I believe, however, and I look forward to discussing whatevertopics you consider relevant today.I recognize that good public service – whether in a state legislature, Congress, orOMB – takes both courage and wisdom. The courage to lead, and the wisdom tolisten. I have learned that I do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Facts – and thecogent arguments of others – matter. I will be loyal to the facts, and to theAmerican people whom I serve.My commitment to you today is to take a fact-based approach to get our financialhouse in order.OMB also fulfills significant management responsibilities, and plays a significantrole in dealing with the regulatory environment – among several other importantfunctions, as you all know.I look forward to talking about any and all of those issues, as this committee seesfit. And if confirmed, I look forward to working with Congress – and serving thePresident – to address these challenges on behalf of the people we all serve."letter,"President Trump is facing a test to his presidency unlike any faced by a modern American leader.It’s not just that the special counsel looms large. Or that the country is bitterly divided over Mr. Trump’s leadership. Or even that his party might well lose the House to an opposition hellbent on his downfall.The dilemma — which he does not fully grasp — is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.I would know. I am one of them.To be clear, ours is not the popular “resistance” of the left. We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous.But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic. That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.The root of the problem is the president’s amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making.Although he was elected as a Republican, the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives: free minds, free markets and free people. At best, he has invoked these ideals in scripted settings. At worst, he has attacked them outright.In addition to his mass-marketing of the notion that the press is the “enemy of the people,” President Trump’s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic.Don’t get me wrong. There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more.But these successes have come despite — not because of — the president’s leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.From the White House to executive branch departments and agencies, senior officials will privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander in chief’s comments and actions. Most are working to insulate their operations from his whims.Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.“There is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next,” a top official complained to me recently, exasperated by an Oval Office meeting at which the president flip-flopped on a major policy decision he’d made only a week earlier.The erratic behavior would be more concerning if it weren’t for unsung heroes in and around the White House. Some of his aides have been cast as villains by the media. But in private, they have gone to great lengths to keep bad decisions contained to the West Wing, though they are clearly not always successful.It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won’t.The result is a two-track presidency.Take foreign policy: In public and in private, President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied, like-minded nations.Astute observers have noted, though, that the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly, and where allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals.On Russia, for instance, the president was reluctant to expel so many of Mr. Putin’s spies as punishment for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. He complained for weeks about senior staff members letting him get boxed into further confrontation with Russia, and he expressed frustration that the United States continued to impose sanctions on the country for its malign behavior. But his national security team knew better — such actions had to be taken, to hold Moscow accountable.This isn’t the work of the so-called deep state. It’s the work of the steady state.Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over.The bigger concern is not what Mr. Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility.Senator John McCain put it best in his farewell letter. All Americans should heed his words and break free of the tribalism trap, with the high aim of uniting through our shared values and love of this great nation.We may no longer have Senator McCain. But we will always have his example — a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue. Mr. Trump may fear such honorable men, but we should revere them.There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first. But the real difference will be made by everyday citizens rising above politics, reaching across the aisle and resolving to shed the labels in favor of a single one: Americans."
