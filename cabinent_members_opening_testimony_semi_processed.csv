"28","Robert Lighthizer","This is an historic day for the United States"
"29","Robert Lighthizer"," Today, for the first time, we will start negotiating to revise a major free trade agreement"
"30","Robert Lighthizer","  American politicians have been promising to renegotiate NAFTA for years, but today President Trump is going to fulfill those promises"
"31","Robert Lighthizer","  I want to thank members of Congress, and their staffs, who have helped lay the groundwork for these negotiations"
"32","Robert Lighthizer","  We look forward to working with them now and in the future as things proceed"
"33","Robert Lighthizer","  I would also like to thank the members of our advisory committees, and other stakeholders, who have given USTR their thoughts about how this agreement can be improved"
"34","Robert Lighthizer","  We held three days of hearings, and we received testimony and comments from thousands of stakeholders"
"35","Robert Lighthizer","  Their suggestions are critical to our process, and we appreciate everyone�s help"
"36","Robert Lighthizer","  First, I know we all agree that NAFTA needs updating"
"37","Robert Lighthizer"," This is a 23 year-old agreement and our economies are very different than they were in the 1990�s"
"38","Robert Lighthizer"," We need to modernize or create provisions which protect digital trade and services trade, e-commerce, update customs procedures, protect intellectual property, improve energy provisions, enhance transparency rules, and promote science-based agricultural trade"
"39","Robert Lighthizer","  In each of these areas, hopefully we will develop model provisions that can be used for years ahead and that have the flexibility to adapt to future innovations that we can�t even imagine at this point"
"40","Robert Lighthizer"," This is an important part of our process"
"41","Robert Lighthizer","  After modernizing, the tough work begins"
"42","Robert Lighthizer"," We must balance the legitimate interests of literally millions of people in our countries -- those of farmers, and businesses, and workers and yes, families"
"43","Robert Lighthizer","  Many Americans have benefited from NAFTA"
"44","Robert Lighthizer"," For many of our farmers and ranchers, Canada and Mexico are their largest export markets"
"45","Robert Lighthizer"," Americans send billions of dollars of corn and soybeans, and poultry across our borders to dinner tables throughout North America"
"46","Robert Lighthizer","  These are hardworking people with families who ask little from their government"
"47","Robert Lighthizer"," Many are particularly vulnerable today because of low commodity prices"
"48","Robert Lighthizer","  I�ve always thought that communities along our borders have a particular equity in this agreement"
"49","Robert Lighthizer"," In many cases their lives, businesses, and families are very much on both sides of the dividing line"
"50","Robert Lighthizer"," They too are hardworking men and women trying to raise a families and accumulate wealth"
"51","Robert Lighthizer"," We must keep their interests paramount"
"52","Robert Lighthizer","  But for countless Americans, this agreement has failed"
"53","Robert Lighthizer","  We cannot ignore the huge trade deficits, the lost manufacturing jobs, the businesses that have closed or moved because of incentives -- intended or not -- in the current agreement"
"54","Robert Lighthizer","  The numbers are clear"
"55","Robert Lighthizer"," The U"
"56","Robert Lighthizer","S"
"57","Robert Lighthizer"," Government has certified that at least 700,000 Americans have lost their jobs due to changing trade flows resulting from NAFTA"
"58","Robert Lighthizer"," Many people believe that number is much, much bigger than that"
"59","Robert Lighthizer"," In 1993, when NAFTA was approved, the United States and Mexico experienced relatively balanced trade"
"60","Robert Lighthizer"," However since then, we have had persistent trade deficits � in the last year totaling nearly $57 billion"
"61","Robert Lighthizer"," In the auto sector alone, the U"
"62","Robert Lighthizer","S"
"63","Robert Lighthizer"," has a $68 billion deficit with Mexico"
"64","Robert Lighthizer","  Thousands of American factory workers have lost their jobs because of these provisions"
"65","Robert Lighthizer"," In recent years, we have seen some improvement in our trade balance with Canada"
"66","Robert Lighthizer","  But over the last ten years, our deficit in goods has exceeded $365 billion"
"67","Robert Lighthizer","   The views of the President about NAFTA, which I completely share, are well known"
"68","Robert Lighthizer","  I want to be clear that he is not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions and a couple of updated chapters"
"69","Robert Lighthizer","  We feel that NAFTA has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement"
"70","Robert Lighthizer","  Here are some of the examples of what I believe needs to be changed"
"71","Robert Lighthizer"," We need to assure that huge trade deficits do not continue and that we have balance and reciprocity"
"72","Robert Lighthizer","  This should be periodically reviewed"
"73","Robert Lighthizer"," Rules of origin, particularly on autos and auto parts, must require higher NAFTA content and substantial U"
"74","Robert Lighthizer","S"
"75","Robert Lighthizer"," content"
"76","Robert Lighthizer"," Country of origin should be verified, not �deemed"
"77","Robert Lighthizer","� Labor provisions should be included in the agreement and be as strong as possible"
"78","Robert Lighthizer"," The agreement should have effective provisions to guard against currency manipulation"
"79","Robert Lighthizer"," The dispute settlement provisions should be designed to respect our national sovereignty and our democratic processes"
"80","Robert Lighthizer"," We should include provisions to guard against market-distorting practices of other countries, including third-party dumping and state-owned enterprises"
"81","Robert Lighthizer"," We should assure that there is equal access and reciprocity in government procurement and agriculture"
"82","Robert Lighthizer","  These are just a few examples of key priorities for the United States � but I think they are sufficient to show that our task is a very difficult one"
"83","Robert Lighthizer","  On the other hand, the stakes are high for all of our citizens and the benefits of a good agreement can be substantial"
"84","Robert Lighthizer","  My hope is that together we will produce a result which moves us to freer markets, fairer and balanced trade, and stronger ties between our three countries"
"85","Robert Lighthizer","  I look forward to working with Secretary Guajardo and Minister Freeland on this very important effort"
"86","Robert Lighthizer"," Thank you very much, and now we will get down to work"
"87","Robert Lighthizer","  "
"88","Robert L. Wilki","Mr"
"89","Robert L. Wilki"," Chairman, Senator Tester and distinguished members of the Committee on Veterans Affairs"
"90","Robert L. Wilki"," This is the third time I have appeared in the confirmation chair"
"91","Robert L. Wilki"," Just as in 2006 and 2017, my wife Julie is with me"
"92","Robert L. Wilki"," We have known each other since we were youngsters in North Carolina"
"93","Robert L. Wilki"," Our high school was two blocks from the Veterans Hospital in Fayetteville"
"94","Robert L. Wilki"," On our way to and from school we could not help but read the sign at the entrance ��The price of freedom is visible here�"
"95","Robert L. Wilki"," I am humbled today not only by the confidence placed in me by the President and the support of our Veterans Service Organizations, but to be introduced by Senator Tillis"
"96","Robert L. Wilki"," No one better exemplifies what those of us who have come through the military world strive to be�a servant leader"
"97","Robert L. Wilki"," I have been privileged to experience military life from many angles, as the son of a gravely wounded combat soldier; as an officer; as a senior leader in the Pentagon, including leading the Defense Health Agency reform, and eight weeks as Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs"
"98","Robert L. Wilki"," My modest military service was inspired by my ancestors"
"99","Robert L. Wilki"," I walked the field of Shiloh with my great grandfather, Colonel Abram Somerville"
"100","Robert L. Wilki"," As a young captain of field artillery, he saw thousands perish in minutes in the Meuse Argonne in 1918"
"101","Robert L. Wilki"," In the short time that I was privileged to know him, he impressed upon me the cost paid by ordinary Americans caught up in the incommunicable experience of war"
"102","Robert L. Wilki"," Mr"
"103","Robert L. Wilki"," Chairman my own life changed when my father returned from his second combat tour in Vietnam"
"104","Robert L. Wilki"," I was seven when we received a message that he had been terribly wounded"
"105","Robert L. Wilki"," When he came home after a year in military hospitals, he weighed less than half of what he did when he left us"
"106","Robert L. Wilki"," I watched his agonizing recovery and that experience was on my mind when I was asked to come to VA"
"107","Robert L. Wilki"," 2 As Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs, I visited five VA hospitals across the country�met with the combined leadership of our three major VA components� Benefits, Health and Cemeteries�and visited our Claims Processing center in Baltimore and the Maryland Veterans Treatment Court presided over by my childhood friend, Judge Halee Weinstein"
"108","Robert L. Wilki"," It is clear that the Veterans population is changing faster than we realize"
"109","Robert L. Wilki"," For the first time in forty years�half of our veterans are under the age of sixty-five"
"110","Robert L. Wilki"," Of America�s twenty million veterans, ten percent are now women"
"111","Robert L. Wilki"," The new generation is computer savvy and demands 21st century service�service that is quick, diverse and close to home"
"112","Robert L. Wilki"," For the VA to thrive as an integrated health care network, it must be agile and adaptive"
"113","Robert L. Wilki"," More importantly, I experienced what can never be duplicated in the private sector�the communal aspect of VA"
"114","Robert L. Wilki"," What does that mean? It means that when our veterans walk into any of VA facility they converse with men and women who speak the unique language of military service"
"115","Robert L. Wilki"," What are the priorities? � Improve the culture�offer world class customer service � Improve access to care through implementation of the MISSION Act and transformative IT Modernization such as the Electronic Health Records Program"
"116","Robert L. Wilki"," � Reduce the backlog of claims and payments"
"117","Robert L. Wilki"," � Business transformation including reform of the human resource systems Mr"
"118","Robert L. Wilki"," Chairman, the prime directive is customer service"
"119","Robert L. Wilki"," When an American veteran comes to VA it is not up to him to employ a team of lawyers to get VA to say YES"
"120","Robert L. Wilki"," It is up to VA to get the Veteran to YES�that is customer service"
"121","Robert L. Wilki"," Many of the issues I encountered as Acting Secretary were not with the quality of medical care but with getting our veterans through the door to reach that care"
"122","Robert L. Wilki"," Those problems are administrative and bureaucratic"
"123","Robert L. Wilki"," Alexander Hamilton said, �The true test of a good government, is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration"
"124","Robert L. Wilki","� That is where VA must go"
"125","Robert L. Wilki"," The new Electronic Health Record system is the first step to modernize our appointment system, it is also the template to get us started on the road to automate disability claims and our payment claims particularly to our providers in rural  3 America and those who administer emergency care"
"126","Robert L. Wilki"," More importantly, the interoperability of the new electronic health records system will connect VA to the DOD, private doctors and private pharmacies to create a continuum of care and organize the healthcare around our veteran�s needs"
"127","Robert L. Wilki"," This is also our opportunity to turn the corner and be an industry leader on opioid abuse intervention and suicide prevention"
"128","Robert L. Wilki"," Business transformation to standardize our policies and procedures across the VISNs is also essential if we are to move past the mid-1990s compartmentalized model and give power to the professionals closest to our veterans"
"129","Robert L. Wilki"," This means reforming human resource systems to give those same people more leeway to manage their budgets and recruit, retain and relocate the staff they need to serve veterans"
"130","Robert L. Wilki"," Transformation also means entering into more robust partnerships with our state and local communities to address Veteran homelessness, that particularly plagues our Vietnam Veterans who also suffer the highest rates of suicide"
"131","Robert L. Wilki"," We are also pledged to help veterans transition to a new life in education and nonmilitary careers"
"132","Robert L. Wilki"," If confirmed, I will leverage VA�s strong partnership with Labor, Defense, and other agencies to carry out this pledge"
"133","Robert L. Wilki"," Mr"
"134","Robert L. Wilki"," Chairman, as Secretary Mattis said when this Congress passed a $700 billion Defense budget, there are no more excuses"
"135","Robert L. Wilki"," You have infused VA with a $200 billion budget, you have passed the Accountability Act�to shake up complacency- -and you have passed the Mission Act to bring the institutional VA, community care and caregivers closer together"
"136","Robert L. Wilki"," The future is up to the Department"
"137","Robert L. Wilki"," If confirmed, I pledge to help build on your work"
"138","Robert L. Wilki"," I would like to close with a charge from President Eisenhower"
"139","Robert L. Wilki"," Five months after his inauguration, about forty Korean War Veterans climbed aboard the yacht Williamsburg�many were missing limbs, some were horribly disfigured"
"140","Robert L. Wilki"," When Ike arrived at the pier, the Secret Service ran up the plank to separate the President from his troops"
"141","Robert L. Wilki"," Seeing that, Eisenhower yelled �Halt! I know these men�"
"142","Robert L. Wilki"," The agents retreated, and the soldiers gathered around the President"
"143","Robert L. Wilki"," He addressed them at attention and said there was nothing the country could do for them to compensate for what they had given to America but, he said, �You never put away your uniform"
"144","Robert L. Wilki"," You must get well, to remind your countrymen every day that freedom is never free�"
"145","Robert L. Wilki","   Mr"
"146","Robert L. Wilki"," Chairman that is why VA must succeed--to remind Americans every day that freedom is not free"
"147","Robert L. Wilki"," "
"148","mnuchin","Thank you very much"
"149","mnuchin"," Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the committee, it is an honor to appear before you today"
"150","mnuchin"," I am grateful and humbled by Presidentelect Trump nominating me to serve as Secretary of the Treasury"
"151","mnuchin"," It is truly an honor and a privilege to be considered for this position"
"152","mnuchin","  Thank you to all the members I have already had an opportunity to meet with during this process"
"153","mnuchin"," I enjoyed meeting with you and learning more about the issues that are important to you"
"154","mnuchin"," For those few members whom I did not get a chance to meet with, if confirmed, I look forward to meeting with you as well"
"155","mnuchin"," I would like to thank Chairman Hatch and his staff for taking so much time to work with me and support me through this process"
"156","mnuchin"," In addition, I would like to introduce my fiance�, Louise Linton, and my children, Emma, J"
"157","mnuchin","P"
"158","mnuchin",", and Dylan, who are here with me today, and thank them for their unwavering support"
"159","mnuchin"," I would also like to introduce my brother, Alan Mnuchin, and his wife, Alessandra, and my father, Robert Mnuchin, who has always supported me and taught me that hard work, determination, and the ability to bring people together can make anything possible"
"160","mnuchin"," I would like to acknowledge my late mother, Elaine Terner Cooper, who was an inspiration to me"
"161","mnuchin"," I would also like to acknowledge my grandparents, Emanuel and Mathilda Terner, who were also a tremendous influence in my life"
"162","mnuchin"," My grandfather was a first-generation American whose father emigrated from Europe"
"163","mnuchin"," He truly embodied the American dream"
"164","mnuchin"," He started out blowing glass bottles by hand and later built Midland Glass into one of the largest glass manufacturing companies in the United States, with five factories employing thousands of workers"
"165","mnuchin"," My first job ever was in his factory when I was in high school"
"166","mnuchin"," It was there that I first learned the importance of humility, hard work, and commitment"
"167","mnuchin"," For those of you who do not know my background, I studied economics at Yale University"
"168","mnuchin"," At the age of 22, after graduating from Yale, I got a job at Goldman Sachs, where I spent the next 17 years"
"169","mnuchin"," I started on a folding chair in the mortgage department"
"170","mnuchin","  Nine years later, after many sleepless nights, I was put in charge of mortgages, U"
"171","mnuchin","S"
"172","mnuchin"," Government bonds, and municipal securities"
"173","mnuchin"," Several years after that, I worked directly for future Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson as the firm�s chief information officer"
"174","mnuchin"," In that role, I oversaw 5,000 people and a $1-billion budget"
"175","mnuchin"," While at Goldman Sachs, I learned the importance of the financial markets in providing liquidity and capital to businesses, governments, and consumers"
"176","mnuchin"," A few years later, I decided to leave Goldman Sachs to build an investment business"
"177","mnuchin"," After working briefly at ESL Investments, I started my own investment business, Dune Capital Management"
"178","mnuchin"," Throughout my career, my commitment was to my clients and shareholders, for whom I worked tirelessly to get the best results"
"179","mnuchin"," Thirty years later, my commitment is now to the American people, for whom I will work tirelessly by helping to grow our economy and create jobs"
"180","mnuchin"," I am eager to share with you why I believe I will serve well as America�s next Secretary of the Treasury"
"181","mnuchin"," But first I want to correct the record about my involvement with IndyMac Bank"
"182","mnuchin"," Since I was first nominated to serve as Treasury Secretary, I have been maligned for taking advantage of others� hardship in order to earn a buck"
"183","mnuchin"," Nothing could be further than the truth"
"184","mnuchin"," During the summer of 2008, I saw the devastation that was caused by the housing crisis when I watched people line up to get their life savings out of IndyMac Bank"
"185","mnuchin"," It was the middle of the financial crisis and, despite the global panic, I saw a way to save the bank"
"186","mnuchin"," I applied for a banking charter and submitted a bid to the FDIC for IndyMac"
"187","mnuchin"," On December 31st, just before midnight, we signed a binding agreement with the FDIC"
"188","mnuchin"," They later confirmed that our bid was almost $1 billion higher than the next best bid"
"189","mnuchin"," We were willing to invest $1"
"190","mnuchin","6 billion into the most costly bank failure ever to the FDIC deposit fund"
"191","mnuchin"," We did this because we believed in our ability to rebuild and create a successful regional bank"
"192","mnuchin"," We believed in recovery for the American economy"
"193","mnuchin"," Let me be clear: my group had nothing to do with the creation of the risky loans in the IndyMac loan portfolios"
"194","mnuchin"," When we bought the bank, we assumed these bad loans, which had been originated by previous management"
"195","mnuchin"," Some of those individuals had to answer to Federal authorities for their bad lending decisions"
"196","mnuchin"," We invested $1"
"197","mnuchin","6 billion into a failing financial institution when most investors were running for the hills"
"198","mnuchin"," We renamed the business OneWest Bank and saved thousands of jobs"
"199","mnuchin"," We developed a prospering community banking franchise in southern California as most banks were pulling back"
"200","mnuchin"," Over the next 2 years, we bought two more struggling banks from the FDIC: First Federal of Santa Monica and LaJolla Bank, both through competitive bidding"
"201","mnuchin"," Combined, we had over 70 branches and built a robust lending business, especially for small and medium-sized businesses"
"202","mnuchin"," As chairman of the bank, I met with hundreds of business people from all walks of life who were seeking loans to grow their businesses and prosper"
"203","mnuchin"," Like many banks at the time, IndyMac, and its reverse mortgage division, Financial Freedom, was unstable due to the large amount of distressed credit mortgages in its portfolios"
"204","mnuchin"," When we bought IndyMac, these ��legacy loans�� were included in the purchase"
"205","mnuchin"," The responsibility landed on me to clean up the mess others made that we inherited"
"206","mnuchin"," We worked very hard to help homeowners remain in their homes through modifications, wherever possible"
"207","mnuchin"," Ultimately, OneWest extended over 100,000 loan modifications to delinquent borrowers to try to help them out of a bad situation"
"208","mnuchin"," I am proud of the fact that loan modifications started at IndyMac under the leadership of the FDIC"
"209","mnuchin"," However, the FDIC loan modification program did not work for everyone"
"210","mnuchin"," When the FDIC took over IndyMac, they estimated that more than half the foreclosures would not meet their test for a loan modification"
"211","mnuchin"," And they demanded many policy conditions: extend assistance to sympathetic borrowers by establishing affordable and sustainable payments by borrowers, increase the net present value of cash flows to the owner of the loan, and stabilize housing markets"
"212","mnuchin"," My group had to adhere to servicing agreements that limited our ability to make loan modifications that could have helped more borrowers"
"213","mnuchin"," In the press it has been said that I ran a ��foreclosure machine"
"214","mnuchin","�� This is not an accurate description of my role at OneWest Bank"
"215","mnuchin"," On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures"
"216","mnuchin"," I ran a ��loan modification machine"
"217","mnuchin","�� When we could do loan modifications, we did them, but many times the FDIC, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and bank trustees imposed strict rules governing the process of these loans"
"218","mnuchin"," I am proud to be able to say that our bank was able to do over 100,000 loans modifications that allowed people the opportunity to stay in their homes"
"219","mnuchin"," Unfortunately, not all of the homes were able to be saved through these programs, and despite my best efforts, some were sadly subject to foreclosure"
"220","mnuchin"," So sincere was my concern over this that in 2010 I instructed my lawyers to sue HSBC, as trustee of the securitized loans, to allow us to do loan modifications on loans in mortgage trusts they oversaw"
"221","mnuchin"," We won on summary judgment and were consequently allowed to do more loan modifications and keep more Americans in their homes"
"222","mnuchin"," Similarly, in 2015, when HUD issued Mortgagee Letter 2015�11, I wrote HUD and asked them to change the policy so we did not have to foreclose on senior citizens who were behind small amounts of money on taxes and insurance"
"223","mnuchin"," I was so troubled by this that I discussed it with our primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency"
"224","mnuchin"," Unfortunately, HUD did not agree, and we were forced to foreclose on senior citizens, even if they only owed $1"
"225","mnuchin"," Not complying with these HUD policies would have subjected the bank to penalties and losses from HUD"
"226","mnuchin"," Despite our inability to save every home from foreclosure, I am proud of the fact that OneWest Bank was the only one of 14 banks that was able to complete the independent foreclosure review that was conducted by the OCC"
"227","mnuchin"," Every one of the 175,000 borrowers who were in the foreclosure process during 2009 and 2010 were able to have an independent review of their loan"
"228","mnuchin"," We had a very low error rate, and independent government reviews routinely showed that we had the most effective loan modifications of any bank"
"229","mnuchin"," If we had not bought IndyMac Bank, the bank would likely have been broken up and sold in pieces to private investors, where the outcome for consumers could have been much more bleak"
"230","mnuchin"," Overall, I helped many homeowners stay in their homes and escape financial ruin through my management of OneWest Bank"
"231","mnuchin"," My experience confirmed that we must identify and eliminate unwise and burdensome policies which contributed to the disastrous outcomes that came in the wake of the financial collapse"
"232","mnuchin"," Many Americans are still suffering from the disastrous ripple effects the 2008 crisis had on our Nation"
"233","mnuchin"," Faithfully ensuring this does not happen again means supporting careful oversight of a financial system which prioritizes the needs of everyday Americans over the wishes of financial institutions or the Federal Government"
"234","mnuchin","  I felt great empathy for the millions of hardworking American families who lost their homes because the system failed them"
"235","mnuchin"," If confirmed as Treasury Secretary, I will work diligently and compassionately for the American people so that we never endure anything like the meltdown of 2008 ever again"
"236","mnuchin"," I was deeply honored when Donald Trump asked me to join his campaign as Finance Chairman"
"237","mnuchin"," I had the opportunity to travel with him and hear firsthand from hardworking Americans about their concerns for the American economy"
"238","mnuchin"," Over the last year, I visited over 50 cities in 26 States"
"239","mnuchin"," I remember attending my first rally with him in Indianapolis"
"240","mnuchin"," It was an unforgettable experience"
"241","mnuchin"," As we arrived into the stadium packed with 20,000 people, I saw the excitement that people had for a Trump presidency"
"242","mnuchin"," On our trip to Flint, MI, I went with the President-elect to visit the water treatment facilities and saw firsthand the crumbling pipes and the devastation caused by that lead-tainted water"
"243","mnuchin"," We met with water engineers and saw the impact it had on that community and the families that live there"
"244","mnuchin"," Across the country on my travels with the President-elect, we heard the pained and heartbreaking stories of Americans who had lost their jobs to workers in foreign countries"
"245","mnuchin"," We heard the concerns of people and small businesses burdened by high taxes just trying to make ends meet"
"246","mnuchin"," In my meetings with you over the last month, you have shared the concerns of your constituents, like farmers who worry about the death tax wiping out the family farms, or workers who are nervous about whether their retirement accounts will be safe from ruin"
"247","mnuchin"," One of the greatest reasons I was drawn to President-elect Trump�s campaign was that it was predicated on a commitment to stimulating prosperity for Americans of all backgrounds, whether they live in the inner city of Detroit, rural North Carolina, the coal country of Ohio or West Virginia, or any place in between"
"248","mnuchin"," I share the President-elect�s goal to economically empower every citizen"
"249","mnuchin"," We will not rest in our mission until that is a reality"
"250","mnuchin"," Among the President-elect�s signature issues in this campaign was reviving trade policies that put the American worker first"
"251","mnuchin"," I will enforce trade policies that keep our currency strong on the world exchanges and create and protect American jobs"
"252","mnuchin"," We will also make America the best place for companies to do business"
"253","mnuchin"," Sensible regulation is a necessity for healthy markets"
"254","mnuchin"," However, I saw firsthand how regulatory excess can inhibit lending by financial institutions, resulting in a lack of access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs"
"255","mnuchin"," Alexander Hamilton remarked that the wealth of a nation may be promoted by, quote, ��multiplying the objects of enterprise"
"256","mnuchin","�� Hamilton knew the unique value of entrepreneurial activity to a thriving economy"
"257","mnuchin"," From our Nation�s earliest days, American businesses have been the greatest repository of ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit in the world"
"258","mnuchin"," We need to unleash that power to generate jobs and create abundance for Americans of all backgrounds"
"259","mnuchin"," We will work diligently to limit regulations, lower taxes on hardworking Americans and small businesses, and get the engine of economic growth firing on all cylinders again"
"260","mnuchin"," In this age of unprecedented online attacks, we must also be vigilant about cybersecurity"
"261","mnuchin"," If confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury, I will use my expertise in technology to protect Americans� information at the IRS and keep our financial architecture safe from malicious attacks"
"262","mnuchin"," I will use the Treasury Department�s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence to stop the financing of terrorism"
"263","mnuchin"," I will partner with other government agencies in our shared goal of allowing our financial markets to operate free from digital and physical threats"
"264","mnuchin"," If I am confirmed as Treasury Secretary, I promise I will work hard with this committee, all members of Congress, and the administration to put forth policies that will help American families reach and maintain prosperity"

"268","elaine chao","Mr"
"269","elaine chao"," Chairman, I want to take a minute to express my condolences to the friends and loved ones of the victims of Friday�s horrific shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport"
"270","elaine chao"," I also want to thank the heroic work that was undertaken by first responders and law enforcement personnel in responding to this shooting"
"271","elaine chao"," Although the investigation remains ongoing, I expect all of us here in Congress to continue exploring ways to protect the traveling public in light of this tragic incident"
"272","elaine chao"," While we made some progress in last year�s FAA bill to double the number of K-9 teams and bolster the screening of airport workers, this shooting serves as reminder that our work to improve airport security remains a constant challenge and is far from complete"
"273","elaine chao"," This year�s FAA reauthorization bill could be a good place to start if more needs to be done to prevent similar tragedies from occurring"
"274","elaine chao"," Mr"
"275","elaine chao"," Chairman, we are here today at a time when our nation is at a crossroads"
"276","elaine chao"," Many of our roads, bridges, tunnels and rails are aging and desperately need to be repaired or replaced"
"277","elaine chao"," Years of neglect and increased demand have brought us to a point where we can no longer sit idly by and watch our country�s most critical infrastructure continue to deteriorate"
"278","elaine chao"," We must step up to the challenge"
"279","elaine chao"," We must commit to build the next generation of great American infrastructure or risk harming our economy and global competitiveness by failing to do so"
"280","elaine chao"," That means investing in projects that will move people and goods for decades to come, such a � Ports � like those in my state of Florida that are responsible for moving goods in and out of our country � Rails and highways that move those goods throughout our states � Transit and rail projects that get Americans to work � Airports and passenger rail projects that connect our communities, and � Technologies of tomorrow that will move people and goods more efficiently and more safely"
"281","elaine chao"," These projects will also create good paying jobs � whether it�s the construction worker laying the foundation for a new project, an engineer doing the design work, or the steel worker making the parts"
"282","elaine chao"," The benefits of updating and expanding our transportation infrastructure can produce thunderous ripple effects � creating new developments, generating increased investments, and driving new economic opportunities"
"283","elaine chao"," This is what our country needs now and for the future"
"284","elaine chao"," But it takes a strong commitment from Congress and the administration, and it will take a significant amount of funding"
"285","elaine chao"," Secretary Chao, I hope we�ll hear more from you today on the incoming administration�s plan and how you intend to pay for it"
"286","elaine chao"," Our nation�s transportation challenges include more than deteriorating roads and bridges"
"287","elaine chao"," Safety continues to be a serious problem across all of our transportation sectors"
"288","elaine chao"," The last two years marked a continuing and disturbing trend of rising fatalities on our highways, reversing the significant progress we�ve seen over a half century"
"289","elaine chao"," The department must aggressively use all of its authority and resources to bring these numbers down, whether its cracking down on drunk and distracted driving, increasing seatbelt use, or getting defective vehicles � such as those with exploding Takata airbags � fixed immediately"
"290","elaine chao"," And the department must also prepare for the future"
"291","elaine chao"," As I speak, automakers are rapidly moving toward commercializing autonomous technology and self-driving cars"
"292","elaine chao"," The department must play a central role in ensuring that this technology is truly safe for the American public"
"293","elaine chao"," Aviation safety is also critical"
"294","elaine chao"," An important task before the committee this year is FAA reauthorization, which is currently set to expire on September 30, 2017"
"295","elaine chao"," Chairman Thune and I worked hard on a bipartisan and comprehensive FAA reauthorization bill last year, which passed the Senate by 95 to 3"
"296","elaine chao"," Unfortunately, our reauthorization bill stalled in the House given a proposal there to privatize Air Traffic Control (ATC) services"
"297","elaine chao"," Besides being costly and disruptive in implementation, such a privatization scheme would upset the partnership between the FAA and the Department of Defense, which provides 15 to 20 percent of ATC services in this country"
"298","elaine chao"," Last, but certainly not least Secretary Chao, I hope we�ll get a commitment from you that you�ll look out for the traveling public by ensuring they have basic consumer protections"
"299","elaine chao"," This means working with us in Congress to make sure that airline passengers know what they are paying for upfront and that these costs are fair"
"300","elaine chao"," These provisions had broad bipartisan support in last year�s FAA reauthorization bill, and we should get them across the finish line this year"
"301","elaine chao"," I look forward to hearing from you, especially about your plans to invest in our country�s future and ensure a safe transportation system for all"
"302","mike pomeo","Senator Dole, thank you for your kind words"
"303","mike pomeo"," But more importantly, thank you for the great service you have performed for Kansas and for America both in your life as an elected official, as a soldier in WWII and as a patriot who worked so hard to build the memorial to honor those who fought in that war"
"304","mike pomeo"," Every Kansan�and I think it�s safe to say, all of your former colleagues here in the Senate�know that they have benefitted from your wit, your patriotism and your kindness"
"305","mike pomeo"," I know that I have"
"306","mike pomeo"," Senator Roberts, thank you too for your kind introduction"
"307","mike pomeo"," I am especially grateful for your guidance over the years, not simply because you are the Dean of our Kansas Congressional delegation, but due to your insights as the former Chairman of this committee"
"308","mike pomeo"," As Chairman, you provided critical leadership during a pivotal and challenging period of American history � during the early years of the Global War on Terrorism and the Iraq War � and I hope I can continue to count on your advice and counsel"
"309","mike pomeo"," Chairman Burr, Vice-Chairman Warner, Senators � I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as the nominee for the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency"
"310","mike pomeo","  2 Should I be fortunate enough to be confirmed by the Senate, I hope to visit you more often from Langley than I have from across the Capitol"
"311","mike pomeo"," I mean this not as a criticism of relations between the two Houses of Congress, but a recognition of how much value I would place on relations between the CIA and its Congressional overseers"
"312","mike pomeo"," I want to thank the members and staff of this Committee for their attention to my nomination over the last few weeks"
"313","mike pomeo"," Since I first joined the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in the 112th Congress, I have felt a special appreciation for the hard work that goes into Congressional oversight"
"314","mike pomeo"," The tremendous honor we have in overseeing the intelligence community is only tempered by the sobering burden of grappling in secret with the many national security challenges facing our country"
"315","mike pomeo"," I would like to thank President-elect Trump for nominating me to serve in this role and for the faith he has shown in me"
"316","mike pomeo"," It is an honor to be selected as the next steward of the premier intelligence agency that is the CIA"
"317","mike pomeo"," I look forward to working with Senator Dan Coats, nominee for the Director of National Intelligence, and supporting him in his critical role, if we are both confirmed"
"318","mike pomeo"," I want to thank my patient and patriotic wife Susan, and my son Nicholas, each whom I love dearly"
"319","mike pomeo"," They are both supporting me here this morning"
"320","mike pomeo"," The two of you have been so selfless in allowing me to return to public service� first as a member of Congress and, now, if confirmed, back working with warriors who keep America safe"
"321","mike pomeo"," I cannot tell you how much it means to have you sitting with me today"
"322","mike pomeo"," 3 I am also grateful to the people of the 4th Congressional District of Kansas, who have entrusted me to represent them in the House of Representatives since 2011"
"323","mike pomeo"," I am proud to have earned and kept their trust, and have cherished every minute of service to my constituents"
"324","mike pomeo"," That said, having been a Member of the House Intelligence Committee and an overseer of our nation�s intelligence enterprise, I understand full well that my job, if confirmed, will be to change roles from policymaker to information provider"
"325","mike pomeo"," My job will be to stay clearly on the side of intelligence collection and objective analysis of our national security challenges� presenting factual intelligence and sound judgments to policymakers, including this Committee"
"326","mike pomeo"," I have spent the majority of my life outside the realm of politics � as a cavalry officer in the United States Army, then as a litigator, and then running two manufacturing businesses"
"327","mike pomeo"," Returning to duty requiring hard work and unerring candor is something that is in my bones"
"328","mike pomeo"," *** Today, I would like to first briefly sketch some of the specific challenges facing the U"
"329","mike pomeo","S"
"330","mike pomeo","; second, address trends in intelligence I have seen from my post on HPSCI; and finally, describe what I see as the CIA�s role in addressing these challenges"
"331","mike pomeo"," Threat Environment First, as many have noted, this is the most complicated threat environment the U"
"332","mike pomeo","S"
"333","mike pomeo"," has faced in recent memory"
"334","mike pomeo"," The litany is now familiar: _ As Director Clapper acknowledged at the beginning of 2016: �there are now more Sunni violent extremist groups, members, and safe havens than at any time in history"
"335","mike pomeo","� 4 _ ISIS remains a resilient movement, has metastasized, and shockingly has controlled major urban centers in the Middle East for well over two years"
"336","mike pomeo"," Whereas a few years ago, we focused on stemming the flow of foreign fighters going to Syria and Iraq, today, the concern is making sure they, and those they inspire, are prevented from expanding their reach, returning home, or slaughtering more innocent people"
"337","mike pomeo"," _ Syria is a failed state and has become one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes of the 21st century"
"338","mike pomeo"," This conflict has led to the rise of extremism, sectarianism, instability in the region and Europe, and the worst refugee crisis the world has faced in recent memory"
"339","mike pomeo"," _ Iran � the leading state sponsor of terror � has become an emboldened, disruptive player in the Middle East, fueling tension with our Sunni allies"
"340","mike pomeo"," _ Russia has reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in t 5 Intelligence Trends Intelligence is vital to every national security issue facing the United States"
"341","mike pomeo"," As some have said, it is the �lifeblood� of national security and is more in demand than ever"
"342","mike pomeo"," _ Intelligence enables better-informed decisions by reducing uncertainty; it is critical in seeking to avoid strategic or tactical surprise, and to giving our armed forces superior domain awareness"
"343","mike pomeo"," _ We rely on intelligence from around the globe to keep danger from our shores"
"344","mike pomeo"," High quality precision intelligence enables our military efforts"
"345","mike pomeo"," _ More and more, intelligence is critical to making effective other elements of national power including sanctions against weapons proliferators, cyber criminals, perpetrators of war crimes, and terrorist financiers"
"346","mike pomeo"," _ We share capabilities and intelligence to improve relationships in furtherance of our national security objectives"
"347","mike pomeo"," Foreign governments and liaison services are vital partners in preventing attacks and providing crucial intelligence"
"348","mike pomeo"," It is important that we thank our foreign partners for standing with us"
"349","mike pomeo"," As we face a deteriorating global picture, the U"
"350","mike pomeo","S"
"351","mike pomeo"," needs to redouble its efforts by ensuring we have more intelligence, not less"
"352","mike pomeo"," Indeed, senior Intelligence Community leaders worry that recent budget cuts will have a silent, corrosive effect�weakening the fabric of the intelligence community"
"353","mike pomeo"," If confirmed, as Director, I intend to be an advocate for a strong and vibrant intelligence community and for CIA�s centrality in that community"
"354","mike pomeo","  6 There are at least five long term trends making the urgency of recognizing and supporting intelligence critically important"
"355","mike pomeo"," _ First, the Intelligence Community finds itself a potential victim of a longer term negative budgetary trend"
"356","mike pomeo"," Given the vital role of intelligence in national security, and given the increasing threats we face, this makes little sense"
"357","mike pomeo"," _ Second, technological advancement across the globe, even by non-hostile countries, is challenging the U"
"358","mike pomeo","S"
"359","mike pomeo"," advantage, as commercial technologies spread into the hands of those who wish us harm"
"360","mike pomeo"," The world is gaining on the U"
"361","mike pomeo","S"
"362","mike pomeo"," _ We have long seen this dynamic with the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missile technology, but increasingly in the cyber domain, countries thought to be unsophisticated, such as North Korea, have overcome what appear to be low technological barriers of entry to engage in offensive cyber operations"
"363","mike pomeo"," The U"
"364","mike pomeo","S"
"365","mike pomeo"," must continue to invest wisely to maintain a decisive advantage"
"366","mike pomeo"," _ The effects of dislocation, lack of governance, and the rise of non-state actors threaten our national security and present critical challenges to the Intelligence Community"
"367","mike pomeo"," This is creating new targets for CIA�s intelligence collection and analysis that compete for attention with the usual state suspects and bad actors"
"368","mike pomeo"," _ Finally, the insider threat problem has grown exponentially in the digital age"
"369","mike pomeo"," Counterintelligence is a perennial issue and we must be increasingly aware that those within our agencies have access to millions of files"
"370","mike pomeo"," By the same token, the use of digital assets by foreign actors creates intelligence opportunities"
"371","mike pomeo","  7 CIA�s Role I want to talk in more detail about today�s challenges"
"372","mike pomeo"," The greatest threats to our national security have always been the CIA�s top priorities"
"373","mike pomeo"," And the CIA has always been at the forefront of America�s comprehensive efforts to meet these threats"
"374","mike pomeo"," Since September 11, 2001, the CIA�s activities have been extraordinary"
"375","mike pomeo"," As the tip of the spear in the war on terrorism, the CIA has put tremendous pressure on our enemies, reducing their freedom to plan, communicate and travel"
"376","mike pomeo"," The CIA has always played integral roles in America�s fight against radical Islamic terror"
"377","mike pomeo"," It sounded warning bells before 9/11 of al Qaeda�s growing global reach"
"378","mike pomeo"," CIA officers were the first into Afghanistan to lay the groundwork for the military effort that struck a major blow to al Qaeda and drove the Taliban from power"
"379","mike pomeo"," From understanding and tearing apart al Qaeda in Iraq networks, to the hunt for bin Laden, the CIA has been at the forefront of the fight every step of the way"
"380","mike pomeo"," My outline above of hard targets and challenges merely skims the surface of the potential threats facing the United States"
"381","mike pomeo"," If confirmed, it will be the CIA�s mission to bring other pressing problems, risks, and challenges from regions and countries that don�t always make the front page to the attention of senior policymakers"
"382","mike pomeo"," Indeed, if we are doing our job, we will help U"
"383","mike pomeo","S"
"384","mike pomeo"," policymakers act early to prevent such problems from becoming front page news"
"385","mike pomeo"," _ It will also be the CIA�s mission, and my own, to ensure the Agency remains the best in the world at its core mission: discovering the truth and searching out information"
"386","mike pomeo"," In this  8 complex threat environment, we must gather intelligence from the most elusive targets and in the most difficult environments"
"387","mike pomeo"," We will need to rely on liaison services and new relationships, which are critical to gathering information around the world"
"388","mike pomeo"," Even so, U"
"389","mike pomeo","S"
"390","mike pomeo"," intelligence must continue to expand its global coverage to keep up with these threats"
"391","mike pomeo"," While intelligence sharing relationships with our friends and allies are important, they cannot replace our own unilateral recruiting and operations"
"392","mike pomeo"," To protect America, the CIA must continue to be the world�s premier espionage service"
"393","mike pomeo"," _ One obvious emerging area for increased focus � both unilaterally and in conjunction with our partners � is the cyber domain"
"394","mike pomeo"," The internet � and the connectivity of our world, systems, and devices � is a borderless, global environment, easily and frequently exploited by sophisticated adversaries like China and Russia, as well as by less sophisticated adversaries like Iran and North Korea, non-state actors, terrorist groups, criminal organizations, and hackers"
"395","mike pomeo"," While NSA and Cyber Command play leading roles, cyber has become critical to virtually every intelligence operation and CIA must continue to operate at the forefront on this issue"
"396","mike pomeo"," _ As the President-elect has made clear, one of my top priorities, if confirmed, is to assist in defeating ISIS"
"397","mike pomeo"," Radical Islamic terrorism is both a symptom and a catalyst of the terrible conflicts raging in the Middle East that have created both a humanitarian and strategic catastrophe"
"398","mike pomeo"," The enduring capability of al Qaeda and its affiliates, the rise and resilience of ISIS and Islamic extremists in Libya and across the Middle East, and the brutality of al Shabaab and Boko Haram, should remind us of the need to maintain an aggressive counterterrorism posture"
"399","mike pomeo"," It is also critical to address what manifestations of this threat and ideology emerge � beyond ISIS and al Qaeda"
"400","mike pomeo"," 9 _ We must also be rigorously fair and objective in assessing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"
"401","mike pomeo"," As the deal permits domestic enrichment and other nuclear research and development, U"
"402","mike pomeo","S"
"403","mike pomeo"," policymakers will need increased intelligence collection and insightful analysis"
"404","mike pomeo"," While as a Member of Congress I opposed the Iran deal, if confirmed, my role will change"
"405","mike pomeo"," It will be to drive the Agency to aggressively pursue collection operations and ensure analysts have the time, political space, and resources to make objective and methodologically sound judgments"
"406","mike pomeo"," If confirmed, I will present their judgments to policymakers"
"407","mike pomeo"," _ The same goes for Russia"
"408","mike pomeo"," It is a policy decision as to what to do with Russia, but I understand it will be essential that the Agency provide policymakers with accurate intelligence and clear-eyed analysis of Russian activities"
"409","mike pomeo"," _ The Agency must also serve as the nation�s sentinel for new and emerging threats and trends, monitoring the convergence of rogue actors and capabilities, and sources of instability that can spread across the globe and undermine U"
"410","mike pomeo","S"
"411","mike pomeo"," national security"
"412","mike pomeo"," This means that the Agency needs the means, capabilities, reach, and awareness to understand and convey where threats are emerging and how U"
"413","mike pomeo","S"
"414","mike pomeo"," interests may be vulnerable"
"415","mike pomeo"," This requires constant innovation, analytic rigor, and operational flexibility � hallmarks of the CIA"
"416","mike pomeo"," As a Member of the House Intelligence Committee, I fully appreciate the need for transparency with the Congressional oversight committees"
"417","mike pomeo"," If the Intelligence Community does not secure the support of the appropriate Congressional authorities for its activities, the legislative backlash from controversial intelligence failures and controversies can be severe and counterproductive"
"418","mike pomeo","  10 We owe it to our constituents to get to the bottom of intelligence failures � as this Committee did with the pre-war Iraq intelligence"
"419","mike pomeo"," But we owe it to the brave Americans of the intelligence community not to shirk our responsibility when unauthorized disclosures to the media expose controversial intelligence activities, or when Edward Snowden, from the comfort of his Moscow safe house, misleads the American people about the NSA�s surveillance activities"
"420","mike pomeo"," I cannot stress strongly enough how proud of the CIA�s workforce Americans would be if they could peek behind the curtains, as the Committee gets to do, to see them in action"
"421","mike pomeo"," The incredible talent, bravery, and ingenuity these patriots put on the line every day in defense of our country are constant inspirations to me"
"422","mike pomeo"," On my first visit out to the CIA headquarters a few years ago, I was walking through an analytical targeting cell"
"423","mike pomeo"," I saw a woman who appeared as though she had not slept for weeks, poring over a data set on her screen"
"424","mike pomeo"," I stopped, introduced myself and asked her what she was working on"
"425","mike pomeo"," She said she thought she was just hours away from solving a riddle about the location of a particularly bad character that she had been pursuing for months"
"426","mike pomeo"," She was not about to abandon her post"
"427","mike pomeo"," She had her mission and its completion would make America safer"
"428","mike pomeo"," A true patriot"
"429","mike pomeo"," In the past years, I have come to know that there are countless men and women just like her working to crush our adversaries with world class intelligence operations"
"430","mike pomeo"," As these quiet professionals grapple with an overwhelming series of challenges in this increasingly uncertain world, they deserve our support and our respect"
"431","mike pomeo"," When we ask them to do  11 difficult things, they should not have to wonder whether we will stand beside them if things go sideways"
"432","mike pomeo"," We should have their backs"
"433","mike pomeo"," Full stop"
"434","mike pomeo"," When there are intelligence failures, operations that go off the rails, or controversial disclosures, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, I pledge to come to the Committee in a timely fashion � and be as forthcoming as possible"
"435","mike pomeo"," But I believe that leaders of the Intelligence Community and Congress owe it to the young men and women who risk their lives for us to do our utmost to keep mistakes from being politicized"
"436","mike pomeo"," This past weekend, I visited Arlington National Cemetery"
"437","mike pomeo"," I�ve done this many times, but on this visit, I paid special attention to the markers that commemorate CIA officers who have perished ensuring our freedom and working to meet America�s intelligence demands"
"438","mike pomeo"," From Afghanistan to Korea and from Lebanon to Africa, and in so many places most Americans will never know, Agency officers put their lives at risk"
"439","mike pomeo"," Too often, because of the nature of their work, we know little about these men and women and what they do"
"440","mike pomeo"," What we do know, is that they were prepared to give so much for each of us"
"441","mike pomeo"," We know the sacrifices of the families of each CIA officer as well"
"442","mike pomeo"," As I walked among these heroes, I was reminded of the sacred trust that will be granted to me if I am confirmed"
"443","mike pomeo"," I will never fail it"
"444","mike pomeo"," I am honored to have been nominated to lead the finest intelligence agency the world has ever known�working to keep safe the people of the greatest nation in the history of civilization"
"445","mike pomeo"," If confirmed, I will be sworn to defend the United States Constitution for the third time in my life � 12 first as a soldier, then as a member of the House of Representatives, and, now, to work for the President and with each of you"
"446","mike pomeo"," I look forward to your questions today"
"447","acosta","Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you this morning"
"448","acosta"," It is an honor to be here as President Trump�s nominee for Secretary of Labor"
"449","acosta"," I know today is a very busy day in the Senate, and I am indebted to the Committee for taking time to conduct this hearing"
"450","acosta"," I want to thank Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz for their kind introductions"
"451","acosta"," I have known both of them for many years"
"452","acosta"," I truly appreciate their support and admire their dedication to public service"
"453","acosta"," I am especially grateful for their support given that my biggest fans�my wife Jan and my two young daughters, Delia and Rosalia�cannot be here"
"454","acosta"," Jan is an amazing woman, a fantastic mother, and I am deeply grateful for her love and support"
"455","acosta"," She is in Miami because Delia, my eldest, has her 1st Grade IOWA tests this week; her sister Rosalia will be in kindergarten next year"
"456","acosta"," Mr"
"457","acosta"," Chairman, I want, in particular, to thank my father and mother because my story begins with that of my parents, and it frames my perspective on the important responsibilities I would assume if confirmed as Secretary of Labor"
"458","acosta"," My parents fled from a Cuban dictatorship in search of freedom"
"459","acosta"," They met in Miami, while in high school, fell in love, and married young"
"460","acosta"," My mother had me while she was still in her teens"
"461","acosta"," Neither attended college"
"462","acosta"," Growing up, I saw my parents struggle"
"463","acosta"," My mother started out as a typist at a real estate firm"
"464","acosta"," At times, she commuted 90 minutes each way to her job"
"465","acosta"," My father served in the Army"
"466","acosta"," Later, he tried to start a small business"
"467","acosta"," But he found that the growing gap between his skills and the demands of being a small business owner too difficult"
"468","acosta"," He went on to hold various jobs, ending his working life as an inventory clerk at a cell phone store"
"469","acosta","  2  Our family lived paycheck to paycheck"
"470","acosta"," My grandmother cared for me while my parents worked full-time"
"471","acosta"," My parents would often go into debt and, at times, take a second job to make ends meet and to provide me with the best education possible"
"472","acosta"," I am here today because of them"
"473","acosta"," My success is their success"
"474","acosta"," Their sacrifice and perseverance made my education possible"
"475","acosta"," They were able to give me opportunities they did not have because even though they didn�t attend college, they had something very important � they had jobs"
"476","acosta"," And though at times they lost their jobs, they were always able to find another job"
"477","acosta"," * * * Mr"
"478","acosta"," Chairman, today many Americans are facing the same struggles my parents endured, only worse"
"479","acosta"," My parents had jobs; but not all Americans have jobs"
"480","acosta"," Some Americans have seen jobs go overseas"
"481","acosta"," Some Americans have seen jobs filled by foreign workers"
"482","acosta"," Indeed, I�ve read reports that some Americans have been asked to train their foreign replacements"
"483","acosta"," And some Americans see that jobs are available, but these available jobs require skills that they do not have"
"484","acosta"," Helping Americans find good jobs, safe jobs, should not be a partisan issue"
"485","acosta"," In my visits with each of you, it was crystal clear that each Member of this Committee wants to help American workers find good, safe jobs�even if you do not all agree on how best to realize this goal"
"486","acosta"," I share this goal with you"
"487","acosta"," We may not always agree on the how, but at least let us agree on the need"
"488","acosta"," If confirmed, I hope to have the benefit of an ongoing dialogue with each of you about how we can advance these goals within the context of a dynamic, global economy that is changing  3  more rapidly with each passing year, and within the constraints of limited resources"
"489","acosta"," *** I would like to close with a brief discussion of a few items in particular"
"490","acosta"," The first is the �skills gap"
"491","acosta","� As I visited with Members of this Committee, I repeatedly heard that in your states the jobs are there, but the skills too often are not"
"492","acosta"," In one of your states, for example, a community college was teaching welding techniques that employers no longer used"
"493","acosta"," Not surprisingly, the students could not get a job when they graduated"
"494","acosta"," We can and must work to reduce the skills gap"
"495","acosta"," We need to make better efforts to align job training with the skills the market demands of its workers, especially as advancing technology changes the types of jobs available in our economy"
"496","acosta"," The Department of Labor, along with local governments, industry, and educational institutions, can partner to have substantial positive impact on American workers"
"497","acosta"," This is the vision of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), of apprenticeship programs, of Job Corps and of many other programs at DOL"
"498","acosta"," If confirmed, I will work with you to maximize the impact of every taxpayer dollar Congress directs towards job training programs"
"499","acosta"," Second, good jobs should also be safe jobs"
"500","acosta"," Congress has enacted workplace safety laws"
"501","acosta"," The Department of Labor enforces these, and if confirmed, I will work to enforce the laws under the Department�s jurisdiction fully and fairly"
"502","acosta"," As a former prosecutor, I will always be on the side of the law and not any particular constituency"
"503","acosta"," Finally, the Department of Labor was formed a bit more than 100 years ago, when the Department of Commerce and Labor was split into two"
"504","acosta"," The intent was this: that a voice for Commerce and a voice for Workers within the Executive Branch would promote better decision-making"
"505","acosta","  4  I support this concept"
"506","acosta"," An advocate for the American workforce within the Administration is important"
"507","acosta"," Whether it is those who are working, those who still seek work, those who are discouraged or underemployed, or those who have retired, if confirmed as the Secretary of Labor, I will advocate for them"
"508","acosta"," I am proud to have the support both of several dozen business groups and of several private-sector and key public safety unions, who remember with respect my prior government work at DOJ and the NLRB"
"509","acosta"," They know that while we did not always agree on the outcome, I always listened and sought principled solutions"
"510","acosta"," If confirmed, I hope we�this Committee and the Executive Branch� can work together in the same way to address the need for good jobs, safe jobs and access to training in the skills that the changing workplace demands"
"511","acosta"," Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to answering your questions"
"512","acosta"," "
"513","zinke","Thank you, Madam Chairman, Ranking Member Cantwell, and members of the committee"
"514","zinke"," Thank you also Montana Senators Tester and Daines for their kind remarks, leadership and continued service on behalf of our great Treasure State"
"515","zinke"," It is an honor to appear before this esteemed Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources"
"516","zinke"," Before beginning my remarks, I would like to introduce and recognize members of my family who have joined me today"
"517","zinke"," My wife, Lolita, who is also a member of President-elect�s Hispanic Advisory Council; my two grandchildren, Matilda and Charlotte; my daughter, Jennifer; and, her husband, Jack"
"518","zinke"," The CHAIRMAN"
"519","zinke"," Welcome"
"520","zinke"," Mr"
"521","zinke"," ZINKE"
"522","zinke"," And for the record, I did tell my daughter, ��Don�t join the Navy and don�t marry a Navy SEAL"
"523","zinke","�� And she did both"
"524","zinke"," [Laughter"
"525","zinke","] My sons, Wolfgang and Konrad, are back at school and hopefully studying today, so they will not be with us"
"526","zinke"," As a son of a plumber and a kid who grew up in a small timber town and railroad town in Whitefish near Glacier Park, I am humbled to be before you as the President-elect�s designee for Secretary of the Interior"
"527","zinke"," I am also deeply humbled because of the great responsibility the position holds to be the steward of our majestic lands, the champion of our great Indian nations and the manager and voice of our diverse wildlife"
"528","zinke"," Upfront, I am an unapologetic admirer of Teddy Roosevelt and believe he had it right when he placed under Federal protection millions of our acres of Federal lands and set aside much of it as our national forests"
"529","zinke"," Today, those lands provide Americans the opportunity to hike, fish, camp, recreate and enjoy the great outdoors"
"530","zinke"," It was on these lands that my father taught me to hunt and fish, and the Boy Scouts taught me the principles of environmental stewardship and the importance of public access"
"531","zinke"," It is also on these lands that many communities, like the community I grew up in, rely on to harvest timber, mine and to provide our nation with critical energy"
"532","zinke"," Without question, our public lands are America�s treasures and are rich in diversity"
"533","zinke"," I fully recognize and appreciate there are lands that deserve special recognition and are better managed under the John Muir model of wilderness, where man has a light touch and is an observer"
"534","zinke"," I also fully recognize the preponderance of our Federal holdings are better suited under the Pinchot model of multiple use, using best practices, sustainable policies and objective science"
"535","zinke"," During the recent centennial of our National Park Service, I found myself at a ceremony at Yellowstone National Park, our first national park established by Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S"
"536","zinke"," Grant on March 1, 1872"
"537","zinke"," As I enjoyed the celebration under the famous Roosevelt Arch, I could not help but notice the words etched on the stone above, ��For the benefit and enjoyment of the people"
"538","zinke","�� I also could not help but notice on the plaque on the side, it said ��Erected by Congress"
"539","zinke","�� When I saw that, I thought this is the perfect policy of land that our great nation should uphold"
"540","zinke"," In order to have great deeds and accomplish great things, both sides have to work together"
"541","zinke"," Higher purpose can only be achieved by both sides coming together for higher purpose"
"542","zinke"," In a nutshell, that is my commitment to you"
"543","zinke"," If confirmed, I will work with each of you to ensure our public lands reflect higher purpose, so that our children�s children, my granddaughters� children, can look back and say we did it right"
"544","zinke"," I have almost met every member of this committee, and I understand that each state is different"
"545","zinke"," I also understand that issues within your state are different and you have different priorities, but I am confident that we can work together to get the job done"
"546","zinke"," When asked about what my goals might be, I would say there are three immediate tasks"
"547","zinke"," The first is to restore trust and working with, rather than against, local communities and states"
"548","zinke"," I fully recognize that there is distrust, anger and even hatred against some Federal management policies"
"549","zinke"," Being a listener and a listening advocate rather than a deaf adversary is a good start"
"550","zinke"," Second is to prioritize the estimated $12"
"551","zinke","5 billion in backlog of maintenance and repair of our national parks"
"552","zinke"," The President-elect is committed to a jobs and infrastructure bill, and I am committed and need your help in making sure that bill includes our national treasures"
"553","zinke"," Third, to ensure that the professionals in the front line, that is our managers and rangers, have the right tools, the right resources and the flexibility to make the right decisions to give a voice to the people they represent"
"554","zinke"," As a former Montana State Senator and current Congressman, I have learned a lot since I was a SEAL in the deserts of Iraq"
"555","zinke"," To accomplish my mission as Secretary of Interior, if confirmed, I know that I am going to need your help"
"556","zinke"," I am going to need your confidence and even perhaps your prayers"
"557","zinke"," I look forward to answering your questions and, if confirmed, representing the interests of our great nation in giving a voice to all Americans, to include our great Indian nations, on how we manage, sustain our public lands and the treasures they contain"
"558","zinke"," Madam Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and this committee, and I look forward to your questions"
"559","zinke"," "
"560","ben carson","Yes"
"561","ben carson"," Well, thank you so much, Mr"
"562","ben carson"," Chairman, Senator Brown"
"563","ben carson"," Thank you to Senator Rubio for that kind introduction"
"564","ben carson"," Thank you to the Members of the Committee, virtually all of whom I have met with, who have been very gracious, and I very much appreciate that"
"565","ben carson"," Thanks also to President-elect Trump for his friendship, leadership, and for his trust for such an important role"
"566","ben carson"," I would like to introduce my family"
"567","ben carson"," Directly behind me is my wife, Candy, of 41 years, my college sweetheart, and starting from this end, my oldest son, Murray, another Yalie, who is an engineer, and his wife, Lerone, who is a youth pastor"
"568","ben carson"," And my daughter-inlaw, Merlynn, who is a physician and a businesswoman, and my granddaughter, Tesora, who is just a sweetie; and my middle son, Ben Junior, or BJ, as we affectionately call him, a very successful entrepreneur businessman"
"569","ben carson"," And our good friend, Marcia Jackson, wife of former Secretary Alphonso Jackson"
"570","ben carson"," And I think you probably know the others here, but Rhoeyce is�oh, there he is, OK"
"571","ben carson"," My youngest son, Rhoeyce, and his father-in-law, Alexander Shabo"
"572","ben carson"," Thank you"
"573","ben carson"," You know, as a youngster, I remember actually feeling that I was pretty lucky"
"574","ben carson"," We lived in a 750-square-foot GI home in southwest Detroit that actually had a lawn and a little one-car garage, and we thought that was paradise"
"575","ben carson"," And then my parents got divorced, and, you know, my mother discovered that my father was married to someone else"
"576","ben carson"," And she did not have any skills"
"577","ben carson"," Basically, a third-grade education"
"578","ben carson"," We had no place to live"
"579","ben carson"," She could not afford the house, so we ended up moving to Boston, moving in with relatives"
"580","ben carson"," So I have actually in my life understood what housing insecurity was"
"581","ben carson"," We were there in Boston for a couple of years, and I remember as a 9-year-old looking through a building across the street, out of which all the windows had been broken, and a sunbeam was shining through it, and it made me think about my future"
"582","ben carson"," I remember thinking that I probably would never live to be 25, because that is what I saw around me, but my mother had very different ideas"
"583","ben carson"," She worked extraordinarily hard as a domestic, leaving the house at 5 in the morning, getting back at midnight, day after day after day, and her strong desire was not to be dependent on anybody else"
"584","ben carson"," And people were always criticizing her, and they said, ��You have two boys"
"585","ben carson"," You can be on Aid to Dependent Children"
"586","ben carson","�� And she said, ��No, I cannot"
"587","ben carson","�� And she worked very hard"
"588","ben carson"," She would sometimes take us to the homes that she cleaned, and many of them were fabulous homes, and she would say, ��Would you rather live in this wonderful place or would you rather live where we live?�� And she would say, ��You know, the person who has this most to do with determining where you live is you"
"589","ben carson"," It is not somebody else"
"590","ben carson"," It is not the environment"
"591","ben carson","�� You know, that made a very strong impression on me, and she insisted later on, when we were able to return to Detroit, still not to our idyllic home�we still could not afford to live there, still in a multifamily, dilapidated place with rats and roaches�but, nevertheless, she was independent, and we still had that dream of being able to get back there"
"592","ben carson"," But I was a terrible student, and she insisted that I read"
"593","ben carson"," She insisted that my brother read"
"594","ben carson"," We were not very enthusiastic about that, but back in those days you had to do what your parents told you"
"595","ben carson"," And as I started reading, I began to discover a whole new world"
"596","ben carson"," We were desperately poor, but between the covers of those books I could go anywhere"
"597","ben carson"," I could be anybody"
"598","ben carson"," I could do anything"
"599","ben carson"," And within the space of a year and a half, I went from the bottom of the class to the top of the class, much to the consternation of all those students who used to call me ��dummy"
"600","ben carson","�� They were now coming to me, saying, ��Bennie, Bennie, how do you work this problem?�� And I would say, ��Sit at my feet, youngster, while I instruct you"
"601","ben carson","�� [Laughter"
"602","ben carson","] Dr"
"603","ben carson"," CARSON"
"604","ben carson"," I was perhaps a little obnoxious, but it sure felt good to say that to those turkeys"
"605","ben carson"," But, you know, I had a very different impression of who I was at that point, and, you know, it is one of the reasons that Candy and I started the Carson Scholars Fund, a component of which are reading rooms"
"606","ben carson"," And we put in reading rooms all over the country"
"607","ben carson"," We have 165 of them now, primarily in Title I schools, where kids come from homes with no books"
"608","ben carson"," They go to a school with no library or poorly funded library"
"609","ben carson"," They are not likely to become readers"
"610","ben carson"," As you know, 70 to 80 percent of high school dropouts are functionally illiterate, and if we can truncate that downstream, you can change the trajectory of their lives"
"611","ben carson"," And that is really what it is about�changing lives and providing opportunities for people"
"612","ben carson"," It makes all the difference in the world"
"613","ben carson"," You know, we had a program at Hopkins, and I would have 700 to 800 students at a time come in on a regular basis"
"614","ben carson"," If you came to Johns Hopkins, some of you probably had me"
"615","ben carson"," You saw all the school buses around"
"616","ben carson"," That was bringing in the kids and trying to encourage them in terms of what they could do"
"617","ben carson"," And I got involved in a lot of the programs, involved more with the East Baltimore Community Development Inc"
"618","ben carson",", and with the community school, and with all the schools and the mayors"
"619","ben carson"," And, you know, that was a very important part of my life, even though I was an extraordinarily busy surgeon"
"620","ben carson"," And I do believe that Government can play a very important role"
"621","ben carson"," I know some have distorted what I have said about Government, but I believe Government is important, and it is there, I believe, to promote life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"
"622","ben carson"," What has happened too often is that people who seemingly mean well have promoted things that do not encourage the development of innate talent in people, and, hence, we have generation after generation of people living in dependent situations"
"623","ben carson"," It is not that they are bad people"
"624","ben carson"," It is that this is what they have been given"
"625","ben carson"," This is all they know, in many cases"
"626","ben carson"," I think we have an opportunity here to do something about that if we take a more holistic approach"
"627","ben carson"," When we talk about HUD traditionally, most people think putting roofs over the heads of poor people"
"628","ben carson"," But it has the ability to be so much more than that, particularly if we take a holistic approach"
"629","ben carson"," And we think about how do we develop our fellow human beings"
"630","ben carson"," I see each individual as human capital that can be developed to become part of the engine that drives our Nation or, if not developed, becomes part of the load"
"631","ben carson"," And we are the ones who are tasked with helping to make the difference"
"632","ben carson"," So I do believe that Government is extraordinarily important, and one of the things that I want to do, instead of just listening to the sage people of Washington, DC�and there are some wise people here�I want to go on a listening tour"
"633","ben carson"," I want to hear from the people with boots on the ground, who are actually administering programs, who are benefiting from the programs"
"634","ben carson"," I want to see what actually works and what does not work"
"635","ben carson"," I want to analyze why it works and why it does not work"
"636","ben carson"," Before I go on the road to do that, I want to do that at HUD"
"637","ben carson"," We have people there who have been there for 10, 20, 30, even 40 years, and I do not think a lot of people listen to what they have to say"
"638","ben carson"," I suspect that they have garnered a tremendous amount of information, and I want to get that information from them"
"639","ben carson"," I want to work with them on a regular basis"
"640","ben carson"," Some people say, ��But medicine�why would you go into something like HUD?�� Well, I actually believe that there is a tremendous nexus, a great intersection, because good health has a lot to do with a good environment, and after working so hard on so many people and then putting them back into an environment with lead and with all kinds of inducements for asthma and other chronic diseases, that is not very helpful"
"641","ben carson"," And I am looking forward to the Safe and Healthy Homes Program at HUD and enhancing that program very significantly"
"642","ben carson"," Why is all this so important? Well, you know, there was a Brookings study, a very important study, which showed that if people did three things, their likelihood of living in poverty would be 2 percent or less, and that is really what we want to do, keep people from living in poverty"
"643","ben carson"," Those three things were graduate from high school, get a job, and wait until you are married to have children"
"644","ben carson"," Think about that"
"645","ben carson"," And, you know, what that means is that there are points of intervention, things that we can do to make a difference in people�s lives"
"646","ben carson"," Also, think about this fact"
"647","ben carson"," In terms of our human capital that is being wasted, we have 5 percent of the world�s population and 25 percent of the prison inmates"
"648","ben carson"," That means there is something wrong"
"649","ben carson"," We have high recidivism rates"
"650","ben carson"," We have people who go into prison with little education and little in the way of skills, and they come out with little education and little in the way of skills"
"651","ben carson"," So what are they going to do? They go back to doing what they were doing before; hence, we have these high recidivism rates"
"652","ben carson"," We need to think about how do we give them education, how do we give them skills, how do we cultivate the innate talent that is in those individuals so that they become part of the engine once again"
"653","ben carson"," And recognize, we only have 330 million people"
"654","ben carson"," Now, that sounds like a lot of people, but that is a quarter of the people they have in India or China"
"655","ben carson"," We are going to have to compete with those Nations into the future, which means we have to develop all of our talent"
"656","ben carson"," Now, you say, ��Well, that all sounds great and wonderful, but you were a pediatric neurosurgeon"
"657","ben carson"," How could you have anything wonderful to say about any of these things?�� Well, you know, I have to chuckle when I hear people say things like that because there is an assumption that you can only do one thing and that we have these very limited brains and they are incapable of learning anything else"
"658","ben carson"," I find that kind of humorous, particularly knowing what the human brain is capable of"
"659","ben carson"," Billions of neurons, hundreds of billions of interconnections can process more than 2 million bits of information in 1 second"
"660","ben carson"," Any brain can do that"
"661","ben carson"," You cannot overload it"
"662","ben carson"," You hear some people say you overload your brain"
"663","ben carson"," You cannot do it"
"664","ben carson"," If you learned one new fact every second, it would take you more than 3 million years to challenge the capacity of your brain"
"665","ben carson"," So we do have the ability to learn"
"666","ben carson"," More importantly, we have the ability to work together, and that is absolutely critical"
"667","ben carson"," We in America�Democrats, Republicans, Independents�we are not each other�s enemies"
"668","ben carson"," We must come to that understanding"
"669","ben carson"," There are real people out there who really want to destroy us, but we do not need to be doing that ourselves"
"670","ben carson"," We need to be combining our collective intellect, and one of the things that I learned in my private life as a board member at Kellogg for 18 years and Costco for 16 years is how to select a good CEO"
"671","ben carson"," And I will tell you, a good CEO does not necessarily know everything about the business"
"672","ben carson"," He is not a marketing specialist"
"673","ben carson"," He may not be a financial specialist"
"674","ben carson"," There are many things that he does not know, but he knows how to pick those people and how to use them"
"675","ben carson"," And that is one of the marks of good leadership"
"676","ben carson"," So, in closing, I have been very fortunate to be able to move from the bottom rung of the socioeconomic level to the top rung and to understand how people feel in all those different levels, and I got to tell you, we are all in the same boat, and if part of the boat sinks, the rest of it is going down, too"
"677","ben carson"," And it means what we need to do is exercise true compassion"
"678","ben carson"," True compassion is not keeping people in a situation where we can feel good about what we are doing"
"679","ben carson"," True compassion is putting them in the situation where they can feel good about where they are going"
"680","ben carson"," Thank you"
"681","ben carson"," "
"682","kirstjen nielsen ","Mr"
"683","kirstjen nielsen "," Chairman, Ranking Member McCaskill, and distinguished Members of the Committee: it is an honor to appear before you today as you consider my nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security"
"684","kirstjen nielsen "," I am humbled and grateful to the President for the trust he has placed in me to lead DHS during such a critical time"
"685","kirstjen nielsen "," I also want to thank Senators Rubio and Portman for their kind words and introductions"
"686","kirstjen nielsen "," Thank you to former Secretaries Ridge and Chertoff for their statements- it was an honor to serve and work with you and I look forward to your continued leadership and stewardship of our homeland security enterprise"
"687","kirstjen nielsen "," Finally, I want to thank former Secretary, now Chief of Staff, General Kelly for his leadership, example and 46 years of steadfast service to our nation"
"688","kirstjen nielsen "," Please allow me to take a moment to introduce the members of my family who are here with me today"
"689","kirstjen nielsen "," My dad, James, my brother, Fletcher, my sister, Ashley, my aunt and uncle, Mary Ellen and Trevor Burton and my cousin Andrew Bragg"
"690","kirstjen nielsen "," I was raised to believe in our country and its founding principles and ideals; to serve our country; and to appreciate and be thankful every day for the freedoms we hold dear as Americans"
"691","kirstjen nielsen "," I am beyond grateful for the values they have instilled in me and their unwavering love and support throughout my life"
"692","kirstjen nielsen "," Thank you for your continued encouragement and for traveling so far to be here"
"693","kirstjen nielsen "," If confirmed as the sixth Secretary of Homeland Security, it will be the greatest honor of my life to again work with and support the remarkable men and women of the Department of Homeland Security who put it all  on the line every day to secure the Homeland"
"694","kirstjen nielsen "," I can�t say enough about the incredible work of the people of DHS many of whom put their lives on the line daily to ensure the safety and security of our nation"
"695","kirstjen nielsen "," Over more than two decades, I have dedicated my career to working on homeland security issues"
"696","kirstjen nielsen "," In both the public (legislative and executive branches) and private sectors, I have utilized my knowledge of homeland security policy, strategy, and operations, as well as my expertise in risk and resilience, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and emergency management to help make our nation more secure"
"697","kirstjen nielsen "," After working on transportation, defense, and government affairs issues and legislation for Senator Connie Mack, I practiced corporate transactional law during which time I learned how private sector company operations are directly affected by organizational structures and delineation of roles and responsibilities"
"698","kirstjen nielsen "," My service in the executive branch began in 2002 at the Transportation Security Administration"
"699","kirstjen nielsen "," At that time, TSA was still part of the Department of Transportation and the formation of DHS was being contemplated"
"700","kirstjen nielsen "," It was an honor to work alongside the countless public servants who stood up TSA and tackled the tough security challenges we faced after the attacks on September 11th and who later helped to stand up the Department of Homeland Security"
"701","kirstjen nielsen "," I was subsequently commissioned by President Bush to serve as a Special Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Senior Director for Prevention, Preparedness, and Response"
"702","kirstjen nielsen "," Charged with interagency policy development and coordination, I led the development of new national strategies and policies, articulating the roles of all levels of government and the private sector in protecting our nation�s critical infrastructure and in strengthening our information sharing"
"703","kirstjen nielsen "," During this time the Nation experienced the devastation of the Gulf Coast that resulted from Hurricane Katrina"
"704","kirstjen nielsen "," Based on the lessons identified from the response to Hurricane Katrina, I led the update and revisions to our  disaster response plans to strengthen our efforts moving into the future"
"705","kirstjen nielsen "," I worked with Congress to draft the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, and co-authored the White House Katrina lessons learned report"
"706","kirstjen nielsen "," As we�ve seen again during this year�s devastating hurricane season, DHS plays a crucial role in disaster preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery working closely with public and private sector partners"
"707","kirstjen nielsen "," I have worked closely with all facets of our emergency preparedness community, and should I be confirmed, look forward to helping to ensure our nation�s resilience to natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other major emergencies"
"708","kirstjen nielsen "," While each aspect of the Department�s mission is important, I believe one of the most significant for our nation�s future is cybersecurity and the overall security and resilience of our nation�s critical infrastructure"
"709","kirstjen nielsen "," The scope and pace of cyberattacks against our federal networks and the control systems that run our critical infrastructure are continually increasing, with attacks growing evermore complex and each more sophisticated than the last"
"710","kirstjen nielsen "," Cyber criminals and nation states are continually looking for ways to exploit our hyperconnectivity and reliance on IT systems"
"711","kirstjen nielsen "," My cybersecurity experience in both the public sector, having chaired the first White House Policy Coordination Committee on cybersecurity, and the private sector, advising government and non-government officials on the development and execution of strategies to mitigate risks and enhance the resilience of our critical infrastructure has prepared me well for the multi-faceted challenge that is increasing our resilience to cyberattacks"
"712","kirstjen nielsen "," I look forward to working with experts at the Department, and within the interagency and the private sector to thwart threats, protect our networks and essential functions and secure our nation�s interests in cyberspace"
"713","kirstjen nielsen "," At the start of the current administration, I also had the honor of serving as Chief of Staff at DHS under then-Secretary Kelly"
"714","kirstjen nielsen "," During that time, I worked closely with state and local officials, cabinet secretaries, foreign partners, and members of Congress on all of the issues that DHS faces"
"715","kirstjen nielsen "," I had the opportunity to develop strong working relationships with current  DHS leadership, and helped to develop many of the Department�s current key priorities and strategies"
"716","kirstjen nielsen "," Our nation is facing a complex threat landscape that is constantly evolving"
"717","kirstjen nielsen "," The threats we face are too many and too varied for any one entity to address them successfully alone"
"718","kirstjen nielsen "," I understand the risks and the resulting challenges the Department is tasked with resolving and I am eager to get to work with all of DHS� partners � domestic and international from all sectors- to find solutions"
"719","kirstjen nielsen "," From my experience at TSA in the early 2000s, to my time in the private sector supporting the homeland security enterprise, I have gained a vast understanding of the Department, its components, and the many challenges it faces"
"720","kirstjen nielsen "," If confirmed I pledge to continue the record of exceptional leadership that General Kelly and Acting Secretary Duke have established at DHS"
"721","kirstjen nielsen "," I vow to the men and women of DHS, to you, and to the hundreds of millions of Americans who rely on DHS every day, to work tirelessly to effectively execute each mission at the Department of Homeland Security"
"722","kirstjen nielsen "," I will work every day to enforce our laws; secure our borders, coasts, and waterways; and protect Americans from dangerous criminals, terrorists, cyberattacks, and the other threats facing our homeland"
"723","kirstjen nielsen "," I also pledge to work every day to give the dedicated men and women of the Department the support, tools and resources they need, and deserve, to carry out their difficult- and often dangerousmissions"
"724","kirstjen nielsen ","  Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today"
"725","kirstjen nielsen "," Should I be confirmed, I look forward to partnering with the Committee and the full Congress to protect and secure our homeland"
"726","kirstjen nielsen "," I look forward to answering the Committee�s questions"
"727","azar","I�m pleased to be joined today by my wife, Jennifer, my daughter, Claire, my son, Alex, and my father, Dr"
"728","azar"," Alex Azar"
"729","azar"," Unfortunately my mother, Lynda, could not be here today, and most tragically my step-mother Wilma passed away just last July from cancer"
"730","azar"," Thank you all"
"731","azar"," Having an opportunity such as this does not happen without family support and guidance"
"732","azar"," Thank you Mr"
"733","azar"," Chairman, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the Committee for the opportunity to appear before you as the President�s nominee to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services"
"734","azar"," Secretary Thompson and Secretary Leavitt, thank you so much for those kind words and for your friendship and mentorship over the years"
"735","azar"," I thank President Trump for the confidence he has bestowed on me"
"736","azar"," Ninety-seven years ago, my grandfather�an impoverished teenager who spoke no English�stepped out of steerage on the S"
"737","azar","S"
"738","azar"," Argentina, completing his long journey from Amioun, Lebanon, to America"
"739","azar"," As he entered the receiving hall at Ellis Island, he met an individual in a military uniform"
"740","azar"," That person possessed the power to admit him or to send him back to poverty and uncertainty"
"741","azar"," That person was a member of the United States Public Health Service"
"742","azar"," It is a testament to all that I love about this country that just 97 years after my grandfather went through his six-second physical on Ellis Island with no discernable prospects other than the political, economic, and religious freedom America offers, his grandson might be  2 in charge of that very Public Health Service, as well as all of the other world-renowned components of the Department of Health and Human Services"
"743","azar"," The mission of HHS is to enhance and protect the health and the well-being of all Americans, through programs that touch every single American in some way, every single day"
"744","azar"," Through its outstanding leaders and career staff, HHS is primed to meet that challenge"
"745","azar"," The task is humbling"
"746","azar"," Marshalling and leading the incredible resources of the Department require innovating, never being satisfied with the status quo, and anticipating and preparing for the future"
"747","azar"," I gained these skills in the dark days after 9/11, as we faced the health and human consequences of those attacks, through the subsequent anthrax attacks and preparedness for potential further biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear attacks, in the implementation of our completely novel Part D prescription drug benefit for seniors, by helping to build global, national, state, and local pandemic flu preparedness, in our response to threats such as SARS and monkeypox, in our efforts to continue to reform welfare programs to make them as modern, responsive, and empowering as possible for the individuals and families we serve, through innovation in the private sector to bring life-improving therapies to our people and the people of the world, and in harnessing the power of big data and predictive analytics to make us more efficient and more capable of serving our fellow Americans"
"748","azar"," With a department the size and scope of HHS, it can be difficult to prioritize"
"749","azar"," Nonetheless, should I be confirmed, I do envision focusing my personal efforts in four critical areas"
"750","azar"," First, drug prices are too high"
"751","azar"," The President has made this clear"
"752","azar"," So have I"
"753","azar"," Through my experience helping to implement Part D and with my extensive knowledge of how insurance, manufacturers, pharmacy, and government programs work together, I believe I bring skills and  3 experiences to the table that can help us address these issues, while still encouraging discovery so Americans have access to high quality care"
"754","azar"," Second, we must make healthcare more affordable, more available, and more tailored to what individuals want and need in their care"
"755","azar"," We all share a common concern for our fellow Americans who are struggling to achieve access to quality healthcare, even if we do not necessarily always agree on how best to go about addressing that challenge"
"756","azar"," Under the status quo, premiums have been skyrocketing year after year, and choices have been dwindling"
"757","azar"," We must address these challenges for those who have insurance coverage and for those who have been pushed out or left out of the insurance market by the Affordable Care Act"
"758","azar"," Third, we must harness the power of Medicare to shift the focus in our healthcare system from paying for procedures and sickness to paying for health and outcomes"
"759","azar"," We can better channel the power of health information technology, and leverage what is best in our programs and in the private, competitive marketplace to ensure the individual patient is at the center of decision making and his or her needs are being met with greater transparency and accountability"
"760","azar"," Finally, we must heed President Trump�s call-to-action and tackle the scourge of the opioid epidemic that is destroying so many individuals, families, and communities"
"761","azar"," We need aggressive prevention, education, regulatory, and enforcement efforts to stop over-prescribing and overuse of these legal and illegal drugs"
"762","azar"," And we need compassionate treatment for those suffering from dependence and addiction"
"763","azar"," These are serious challenges that require a serious-minded sense of purpose, and, if confirmed, I will work with the superb team at HHS to deliver serious results"
"764","azar"," I thank President Trump for this important opportunity to serve the American people, and I thank you for your consideration of my nomination"
"765","rick perry","U"
"766","rick perry","S"
"767","rick perry"," Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, January 19, 2017 Chairman Murkowski, Ranking Member Cantwell, and distinguished members of this committee, it is an honor to appear before you as President elect Trump�s nominee for the Secretary of Energy"
"768","rick perry"," This confirmation process has been extremely informative and beneficial for me, and the individual discussions I had with many of the members of this committee were the most important aspect of that process"
"769","rick perry"," I especially want to thank Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell for speaking passionately and frankly about their priorities for the country as it relates to energy policy"
"770","rick perry"," You may be of different parties, but I noted during those meetings what you have in common"
"771","rick perry"," Both of you talked passionately about energy development, the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile, the vital role of our national labs, the critical importance of grid security, and the unique situations in your states"
"772","rick perry"," And both of you talked about these complex issues without the benefit of notes"
"773","rick perry"," You know well the challenges and issues facing the Secretary of Energy"
"774","rick perry"," If I am confirmed, I look forward to working with you"
"775","rick perry"," Before I go further, I want to recognize my strongest advocate and supporter who has been there every step of the way since we met at a piano recital in 1958 � my wife Anita"
"776","rick perry"," It has been quite the journey for us, from a dryland cotton farm with a house that had just received power from the Rural Electrification Agency, to appointment to serve as our nation�s Secretary of Energy"
"777","rick perry"," With us today is our pride and joy, our daughter Sydney, and her husband Brett"
"778","rick perry"," I arrive at this appointment with three decades of experience in elected service � as a state representative, a state commissioner of agriculture, lieutenant governor, and governor of Texas for 14 years"
"779","rick perry"," During my three and a half terms as governor, I led a state that created 2"
"780","rick perry","2 million jobs, that added more people than any other state, and would stand alone as the world�s 12th largest economy"
"781","rick perry"," We were also the nation�s leading energy producing state � not just in terms of oil and gas, but wind energy too"
"782","rick perry"," I have firsthand experience with the shale energy boom that revolutionized American energy and with state-led cleanup efforts to improve our environment"
"783","rick perry"," As Governor, I also learned the management skills for running a state, and have the executive experience necessary for leading an organization as large as the Department of Energy"
"784","rick perry"," From this experience, I learned how important energy is to the American economy, and the great responsibility we have to take care of what we�ve been given and to protect our citizens"
"785","rick perry"," If I am so fortunate as to be confirmed, this experience will inform my priorities at the Department"
"786","rick perry","  I am committed to keeping Americans safe"
"787","rick perry"," Nuclear security is the largest portion of the Department of Energy�s budget"
"788","rick perry"," I will be focused on continuing to protect and modernize the nation�s nuclear stockpile"
"789","rick perry"," As a former Air Force pilot during the days of the Cold War, I understand the deterrent value of our nuclear weapons systems, and the vital role they play in keeping the peace"
"790","rick perry"," Another aspect of security is ensuring the reliability of our electric grid and protecting against cyber security attacks"
"791","rick perry"," I am committed to undertaking enhanced security measures where necessary and assisting with recovery efforts, so that Americans can depend on stable sources of power"
"792","rick perry"," I will draw upon my years of experience as governor of a coastal state in organizing emergency response personnel to handle disasters effectively and efficiently"
"793","rick perry"," If confirmed, I will advocate and promote American energy in all forms, and that includes renewables"
"794","rick perry"," America has been blessed with vast natural resources and the technology to utilize them"
"795","rick perry"," I am committed to helping provide stable, reliable, affordable, and secure sources of American energy"
"796","rick perry"," An American first energy strategy is important to create jobs and grow the economy"
"797","rick perry"," I am a major proponent of maintaining American leadership in the area of scientific inquiry"
"798","rick perry"," I support the academic and government mission of basic research, even when it will not yield benefits for a generation"
"799","rick perry"," Our scientists and labs are the envy of the world"
"800","rick perry"," I look forward to visiting our national labs this year, if confirmed, and learning more about the unique work they are doing"
"801","rick perry"," I have a long record of aggressively courting leading scientific minds to bring innovation and job creation to my home state"
"802","rick perry"," Furthermore, I understand, and am committed to, the vital role the Department of Energy maintains in environmental cleanup, and specifically cleaning up nuclear waste, a legacy of the Cold War"
"803","rick perry"," I have experience in dealing with the difficult challenges of transporting and storing low-level waste in my home state of Texas"
"804","rick perry"," I know this is a daunting task at the federal level, with 35 states temporarily housing waste from various nuclear programs"
"805","rick perry"," I look forward to working with the members of this committee to address the concerns many of you are hearing back home about nuclear waste facilities"
"806","rick perry"," In summary, I am committed to modernizing our nuclear stockpile, promoting and developing American energy in all forms, advancing the department�s critical science and technology mission, and carefully disposing of nuclear waste"
"807","rick perry"," In my limited time, let me address a couple more issues"
"808","rick perry"," I have learned a great deal about the important work being done every day by the outstanding men and women of the DOE"
"809","rick perry"," I have spoken several times to Secretary Moniz and his predecessors"
"810","rick perry"," If confirmed, my desire is to lead this agency in a thoughtful manner, surrounding myself with expertise on the core functions of the department"
"811","rick perry"," My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking"
"812","rick perry"," In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination"
"813","rick perry"," If confirmed, I will enter this role excited and passionate about advancing the core missions of the DOE, and drawing greater attention to the vital role played by the agency and the hard working men and women who dedicate themselves in pursuit of these missions"
"814","rick perry"," Second, let me speak to the issue of climate change"
"815","rick perry"," I believe the climate is changing"
"816","rick perry"," I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by manmade activity"
"817","rick perry"," The question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn�t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy, or American jobs"
"818","rick perry"," In Texas, we have a record of taking action to address environmental challenges, including climate change"
"819","rick perry"," Despite a fast-growing population and one of the largest petro-chemical refining industries in the world, we saw our climate and air quality improve"
"820","rick perry"," Our power plants reduced their carbon output by 17 percent, sulfur dioxide by 56 percent and nitrous oxide by 66 percent"
"821","rick perry"," We decommissioned 137 older, dirtier power plants while providing incentives for clean technology, such as clean coal and carbon capture and underground storage"
"822","rick perry"," In Houston, the billion dollar Petra Nova plant will be opening soon using carbon capture sequestration"
"823","rick perry"," We are also using carbon injected into wells for enhanced oil field recovery"
"824","rick perry"," I signed a law to retrofit more than 15,000 engines under the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan, and we have provided incentives for energy efficiency"
"825","rick perry"," Our willingness to develop natural gas, and tap shale formations has helped not only Texas reduce its carbon footprint, but other states and Mexico as well"
"826","rick perry"," But we truly advocated an all of the above strategy, reducing carbon emissions not just through development of cleaner fossil fuels, but through the development of renewable sources too"
"827","rick perry"," During my time as governor, Texas took the national lead in wind energy development, and now produces more wind power than all but five countries"
"828","rick perry"," When it comes to climate change, I am committed to making decisions based on sound science and that also take into account the economic impact"
"829","rick perry"," We need an energy policy for the 21st century that is focused on promoting American energy in all forms"
"830","rick perry"," I am committed to working with this committee and the incoming Administration to do so"
"831","rick perry"," This is a historic time for America and for the energy sector"
"832","rick perry"," I would be honored to be a part of it"
"833","rick perry"," Thank you"
"834","devos","Chairman Alexander, Ranking Member Murray, Senators, thank you for the opportunity to be with you this afternoon"
"835","devos"," I want to begin by thanking my family for their support: my husband, Dick, my sons, and daughters, and sons-in-law -- as well as the rest of my family, including five grandchildren, who could not join us today"
"836","devos"," I am honored that President-elect Trump asked me to join his team and am grateful for his dedication to education"
"837","devos"," If confirmed, I look forward to working with him, Vice President-elect Pence and all of you to bring educational opportunity to every family in this great nation"
"838","devos"," While we may have differences, I think we can all agree that learning as a lifelong pursuit is a fundamental American virtue"
"839","devos"," We are blessed beyond measure with educators who pour themselves into students"
"840","devos"," The schools in which they work are as diverse as the students they educate"
"841","devos"," In fact, all of us here � and our children � have attended a mix of traditional publicly-funded and private schools"
"842","devos"," This is a reflection of the diversity that is today�s American public education"
"843","devos"," Growing up in Holland, Michigan, I attended local Christian schools and then Calvin College"
"844","devos"," My greatest educational influence in life was a public school teacher named Elsa Prince"
"845","devos"," While her students called her Mrs"
"846","devos"," Prince, to this day, I just call her �mom"
"847","devos","� When Dick and I became parents, education took on a whole new meaning"
"848","devos"," We recognized that other parents were not able to make similar decisions about their children�s education, based on their income or the zip code in which they lived"
"849","devos"," When our oldest reached school age, we visited The Potter's House, a Christian school which serves many low income families in my hometown"
"850","devos"," We saw the struggles and sacrifices many of these families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children"
"851","devos"," For me this was not just an issue of public policy but of national injustice"
"852","devos"," I committed to do something about it, and it�s become my life�s work"
"853","devos"," I applaud the great work of The Potter�s House and its founder John Booy � who is here with us today � he and his team of teachers are doing a great job"
"854","devos"," But here�s the sad reality: in the past 28 years, the need and demand for these other options have grown, unabated"
"855","devos","  I share President-elect Trump�s view that it�s time to shift the debate from what the system thinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve"
"856","devos"," Parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning meets the needs of every child, and they know other options exist, whether magnet, virtual, charter, home, religious, or any combination thereof"
"857","devos"," Yet, too many parents are denied access to the full range of options� choices that many of us -- here in this room -- have exercised for our own children"
"858","devos"," Why, in 2017, are we still questioning parents� ability to exercise educational choice for their children? I am a firm believer that parents should be empowered to choose the learning environment that�s best for their individual children"
"859","devos"," The vast majority of students in this country will continue to attend public schools"
"860","devos"," If confirmed, I will be a strong advocate for great public schools"
"861","devos"," But, if a school is troubled, or unsafe, or not a good fit for a child � perhaps they have a special need that is going unmet -- we should support a parent�s right to enroll their child in a high quality alternative"
"862","devos"," It�s really pretty simple"
"863","devos"," Every child in America deserves to be in a safe environment that is free from discrimination"
"864","devos"," Every student in America dreams of developing his or her unique talents and gifts"
"865","devos"," Every parent in America dreams of a future when their children have access to schools with the rigor, challenges, and safe environments that successfully prepare them for a brighter, more hopeful tomorrow"
"866","devos"," And every teacher in America dreams of breaking free from standardization, so that they can deploy their unique creativity and innovate with their students"
"867","devos"," Our nation�s schools are filled with talented, devoted professionals, who successfully meet the needs of many, many children"
"868","devos"," But even our best schools don't work for all"
"869","devos"," This isn�t the fault of teachers, but a reality that all students are unique, learn differently, and excel at their own pace"
"870","devos"," Students also face new challenges today"
"871","devos"," In particular, our high school graduates are having increasing difficulty accessing affordable higher education"
"872","devos"," Escalating tuition is pricing aspiring and talented students out of college"
"873","devos"," Others are burdened with debts that will take years � or even decades -- to pay off"
"874","devos"," There is no magic wand to make the debt go away, but we do need to take action"
"875","devos"," It would be a mistake to shift that burden to struggling taxpayers without first addressing why tuition has gotten so high"
"876","devos"," For starters, we need to embrace new pathways of learning"
"877","devos"," For too long a college degree has been pushed as the only avenue for a better life"
"878","devos"," The old and expensive brick-mortar-and-ivy model is not the only one that will lead to a prosperous future"
"879","devos"," Craftsmanship is not a fallback - but a noble pursuit"
"880","devos"," Students should make informed choices about what type of education they want to pursue post high school and have access to high quality options"
"881","devos"," President-elect Trump and I agree we need to support all post-secondary avenues, including trade and vocational schools, and community colleges"
"882","devos"," Of course, on every one of these issues, Congress will play a vital role"
"883","devos"," If confirmed, I look forward to working with you to enact solutions that empower parents and students, provide high quality options and spend tax dollars wisely"
"884","devos"," We will work together to ensure the Every Student Succeeds Act is implemented as Congress intended -- with local communities freed from burdensome regulations from Washington"
"885","devos"," And I look forward to working with Congress and all stakeholders to reauthorize the Higher Education Act to meet the needs of today�s college students"
"886","devos"," President-elect Trump and I know it won�t be Washington, D"
"887","devos","C"
"888","devos"," that unlocks our nation�s potential, nor a bigger bureaucracy, tougher mandates or a federal agency"
"889","devos"," The answer is local control and listening to parents, students and teachers"
"890","devos"," For nearly three decades, I�ve been involved in education, as a volunteer, an advocate for children, and a voice for parents"
"891","devos"," I�ve worked as an in-school mentor for students in the Grand Rapids Public Schools, and have had the privilege of interacting with students and their families and teachers in ways that have changed my life and my perspective about education forever"
"892","devos"," I�ve worked with Governors, legislators, and business and community leaders to expand educational opportunity through options that are making a lifetime of difference for hundreds of thousands of kids this year alone"
"893","devos"," And, I�ve worked with many dedicated teachers who strive every day to help students achieve, fulfill their potential, and prepare them for the global challenges that they will face"
"894","devos"," For me, it�s simple: I trust parents, and I believe in our children"
"895","devos"," Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you"
"896","devos"," I look forward to answering your questions"
"897","sonny perdue","Good Morning Chairman Roberts, Ranking Member Stabenow, and distinguished Members of the Committee"
"898","sonny perdue"," It is an honor to be with you today as the President�s nominee to serve as our nation�s 31st Secretary of Agriculture"
"899","sonny perdue"," I know from visiting with you in your offices, there was some anxiety over whether there would be a Secretary of Agriculture nominee, but I must say with all humility I can muster, I think the president saved the best for last"
"900","sonny perdue"," I�d like to thank each of you for making time to meet individually with me over the last few weeks to discuss the current state of our agricultural community and the issues we will face in the future"
"901","sonny perdue"," I hope and trust that these meetings will not just be introductory episodes, but ongoing opportunities to listen and learn from one another"
"902","sonny perdue"," And, I�d also like to thank each of you for the opportunity to be here today to answer all your questions as you consider my nomination and carry out the Senate�s very important constitutional role in this confirmation process"
"903","sonny perdue"," I think it is altogether fitting and proper that this Committee convenes this hearing during the same week we celebrate National Agriculture Week"
"904","sonny perdue"," I hope that, by working together, we can continue our nation�s agricultural preeminence, building the innovative progress of years gone by and growing to meet the needs and demands of customers and consumers here in America and around the world"
"905","sonny perdue"," However, before I continue and address my priorities, I would like to take a moment and introduce my family members who are here with me today"
"906","sonny perdue"," I�m accompanied by my lovely wife, Mary"
"907","sonny perdue"," I had no idea, when we married 44 years ago, I was marrying such a prolific grandmother"
"908","sonny perdue"," As you can see, seated with Mary are our four children, their spouses, and 12 of our 14 grandchildren, all of whom are more familiar with my being called Big buddy, rather than any other titles I�ve had"
"909","sonny perdue"," I�m also pleased and frankly humbled, after seven years, to have over 40 of my former staff present, who labored side-by-side with me in serving the state and the people of Georgia"
"910","sonny perdue"," You�ve all read my bio and poured over my personal and professional history, but if you�ll indulge me, I�d like to tell you a little bit about myself"
"911","sonny perdue"," As a youngster growing up on a dairy and diversified row crop farm in a rural area of Georgia I never fully realized that the blessings of purposeful, meaningful work would serve me as well as they have in life"
"912","sonny perdue"," When I was a young boy feeding the calves and plowing the fields, I was an integral part of the workforce there on my father�s farm"
"913","sonny perdue"," My mother was an English teacher for 42 years, so I benefitted from her teachings as well � not just by her raising me with the beliefs I hold so dear to my heart, but being an English teacher, she even made sure I knew all about dangling participles"
"914","sonny perdue"," It was a great life"
"915","sonny perdue"," I had a blessed upbringing with wonderful memories"
"916","sonny perdue"," My favorite hobbies as a youngster were training bird dogs, riding my horse Trigger, and playing Little League baseball"
"917","sonny perdue"," Even as a youngster, I was determined and goal-oriented"
"918","sonny perdue"," Early on, I set my heart on becoming a veterinarian, so, after high school, I enrolled at the University of Georgia, where I also walked on to play football for the UGA Bulldogs"
"919","sonny perdue"," Play is probably not the operative word, but I was on the team! Realizing that my future was not on the football field, I decided to apply myself to my studies"
"920","sonny perdue"," As I entered Veterinary school in 1967, Viet Nam was roiling, so I signed up for an early commissioning program in the U"
"921","sonny perdue","S"
"922","sonny perdue"," Air Force"
"923","sonny perdue"," As I finished my veterinary education in 1971, I began to fulfil the active duty service to which I had agreed"
"924","sonny perdue"," I was assigned to Columbus, Ohio as a base veterinarian, whose primary responsibilities were food safety, public health, and sanitation"
"925","sonny perdue"," Following completion of my active duty commitment, I joined a small veterinary practice in Raleigh, North Carolina"
"926","sonny perdue"," I soon realized, even though our practice was thriving, that I missed the farm and my former agricultural way of life"
"927","sonny perdue"," So, in 1976, Mary and I and our two small girls moved back home where I partnered with my brother-in-law to build a grain elevator in my home county, which didn�t yet have one"
"928","sonny perdue"," Sadly, he passed away in January of 1980 at the age of 43"
"929","sonny perdue"," I�ve been in agribusiness since 1977"
"930","sonny perdue"," I am the founder and operator of three agribusiness and transportation firms serving farmers across the Southeastern United States"
"931","sonny perdue"," Farming and farmers have been my life ever since"
"932","sonny perdue"," I have lived and breathed the exhilaration of a great crop and the despair and devastation of a drought"
"933","sonny perdue"," I learned by experience what my father had told me as a child, �If you take care of the land, the land will take care of you�"
"934","sonny perdue"," Let�s fast forward to what you�re probably more interested in, my years as a public servant"
"935","sonny perdue"," I want to be clear"
"936","sonny perdue"," Growing up, I wasn�t one of those 16-year-olds who shook the hand of a president and was inspired to run for office"
"937","sonny perdue"," I was always tuned into current events, but I had no early interest in elected politics"
"938","sonny perdue"," I did understand we all have civic rent, so I agreed to chair our local planning and zoning commission"
"939","sonny perdue"," After 10 years, a State Senate seat became open and I was asked to run for the seat"
"940","sonny perdue"," I initially declined but a pre-planned family trip to Williamsburg, Virginia changed my mind after observing the founder�s goals of citizen engagement"
"941","sonny perdue"," In 1990, the people of District 18 elected me to serve as a member of the Georgia State Senate"
"942","sonny perdue"," I served for 11 years and during my tenure, was elected by my colleagues to be Senate President pro Tem, the pinnacle of leadership in that body, from 1996 until 1998"
"943","sonny perdue"," You�ve probably heard, and it�s interesting to note, that I served both as a Democrat and as a Republican while in the Georgia State Senate"
"944","sonny perdue"," In 2002, I was elected the first Republican Governor of Georgia in more than 130 years"
"945","sonny perdue"," I assumed that office, believing that it was a big job, not a position"
"946","sonny perdue"," Our team worked diligently for eight years, striving to make Georgia the best managed state in the nation"
"947","sonny perdue"," As you remember, the period from 2003 to 2011, were not the best economic times for our nation"
"948","sonny perdue"," But, we learned, with the help of a joyful state workforce, we could continue to provide value to the citizens of Georgia, even in times of extreme budget pressures"
"949","sonny perdue"," Even though Georgia may not compare to some of your states in some agricultural sectors, I am still proud to come from a state whose number one economic driver is agriculture"
"950","sonny perdue"," In Georgia, agriculture is one area where Democrats and Republicans consistently reached across the aisle and work together"
"951","sonny perdue"," It�s important to note that the makeup of this Committee speaks directly to the size, reach and diversity of America�s agricultural sector and that reaching across the aisle is common practice within this Committee, where partisanship doesn�t get in the way of good solutions for American farmers, ranchers, and consumers"
"952","sonny perdue"," And to that end, if confirmed as the Secretary of Agriculture, I look forward to working with you � each of you � to find solutions to the challenges confronting American Agriculture"
"953","sonny perdue"," Though I have a lifetime of experience with farming and agribusiness, I appreciate that the Department of Agriculture touches the lives of all Americans in many ways that go beyond farming itself, including, in a small way, improving the lives of the �least of these�"
"954","sonny perdue"," As I answer your questions today, know that I approach this opportunity as I did when I was Governor"
"955","sonny perdue"," This is a big job with enormous responsibility, not just a position"
"956","sonny perdue"," Whether it�s communicating a vision for USDA, managing competing policy priorities within the Department and Agencies, or influencing the Farm Bill or budget discussions, I will dedicate my time as I said to each of you in our personal meetings � through open, honest, and efficient communication"
"957","sonny perdue"," If I am honored with Senate confirmation, I will work tirelessly to advance four primary goals"
"958","sonny perdue"," And each of those goals is focused on an important constituency, the stakeholders of American agriculture"
"959","sonny perdue"," First, I will maximize the ability of the men and women of America�s agriculture and agribusiness sector to create jobs "
"960","sonny perdue",""
"961","sonny perdue",""
"962","sonny perdue"," to produce and sell the foods and fiber that feed and clothe the world "
"963","sonny perdue",""

"971","sonny perdue"," And fourth � American agricultural bounty comes directly from the land"

"985","haley"," Chairman"
"986","haley"," And thank you, Senator Cardin, for your comments"
"987","haley"," And I certainly look forward to discussing all of those things with you and the rest of the committee"
"988","haley"," I do have my family behind me because I've never been able to do anything without the support of my family"
"989","haley"," And so to my left, I have my favorite younger brother, Gogi Randhawa, who owns his own business and is an entrepreneur"
"990","haley"," I have my parents, Dr"
"991","haley"," and Mrs"
"992","haley"," Randhawa, who reminded my brothers, my sister and me every day how blessed we were to live in this country"
"993","haley"," I have my amazing husband, but also the coolest first man ever, but he is also a combat veteran, Michael is behind me"
"994","haley"," And next to him is one of my pride and joy kids and that's Nalin who is wearing a suit today, which he would prefer not wearing, but he does have his basketball shoes on"

"996","haley"," I have in my in-laws, Bill and Carol Haley, who have been an amazing support to me and a second set of parents to us as we've gone through struggles"

"998","haley"," And then I have lots of friends behind them as well"
"999","haley"," And so I told them if I started to mess up, one of them needed to act like a protester"
"1000","haley"," So we will see if that happens"
"1001","haley"," I think she's going to do very well at the United Nations"
"1002","haley"," So with that, I would like to say, Chairman Corker, Ranking Member Cardin, distinguished members of the committee, I come before you today both humbled and honored to be considered to represent the United States of America at the United Nations"
"1003","haley"," Just as other nominees for this position have done, I'm here to outline my vision and discuss my qualifications"
"1004","haley"," My story is an American story"
"1005","haley"," I was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, the daughter of immigrant parents from Punjab, India"
"1006","haley"," My parents had comfortable lives in India, but they chose to give up those comforts and move to America with just $8 in their pockets, because of the freedoms and the opportunities this country offers"
"1007","haley"," Our family's experience is unique, but it is also familiar because it is one that has been repeated many times by many people in American history"
"1008","haley"," Growing up in a small rural community in the South, our family was different"
"1009","haley"," We were not white enough to be white, we were not black enough to be black"
"1010","haley"," My father wore a turban, my mother wore a sari"
"1011","haley"," Our new neighbors didn't quite know what to make of us, so we did face challenges, but those challenges paled next to the abundance of opportunities in front of us"
"1012","haley"," My dad was a professor at a small historically black college, my mom was a social studies teacher and started a clothing store from scratch"
"1013","haley"," I started doing the books for the family business when I was 13"
"1014","haley"," It wasn't until I got to college that I realized that wasn't normal"
"1015","haley"," But it was normal to me"
"1016","haley"," In my family we worked"
"1017","haley"," I was also privileged to take advantage of the educational opportunities that America affords"
"1018","haley"," And I am painfully aware that the chance for 13-year-old girls to read and learn and grow is something that does not exist in far too many places around the world today"
"1019","haley"," I went on to serve in South Carolina general assembly and to be elected and reelected governor of the palmetto state"
"1020","haley"," Serving the people of South Carolina has been the greatest honor of my life"
"1021","haley"," During the six years of my governorship, our state has faced many challenges, but South Carolina today is stronger economically and more united culturally than it has ever been before"
"1022","haley"," And I couldn't be more proud"
"1023","haley"," While South Carolina will always be my home, I am eager to begin this new chapter"
"1024","haley"," International diplomacy is a new area for me"
"1025","haley"," There is much I am learning about the intricacies of the U"
"1026","haley","N"
"1027","haley"," and its associated agencies"
"1028","haley"," I don't claim that I know everything or that leadership at the U"
"1029","haley","N"
"1030","haley"," is the same as leading South Carolina"
"1031","haley"," But diplomacy itself is not new to me"
"1032","haley"," In fact, I would suggest there is nothing more important to a governor's success than her ability to unite those with different backgrounds, viewpoints and objectives behind a common purpose"
"1033","haley"," For six years that has been my work, day after day, in times of celebration and in times of great tragedy"
"1034","haley"," I have negotiated deals with some of the largest corporations in the world and convinced them to make South Carolina their home"
"1035","haley"," I have been the chief executive of a government with more than 67,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $26 billion"
"1036","haley"," And we have achieved real results"
"1037","haley"," South Carolina is a different, stronger, better place than it was six years ago"
"1038","haley"," Like most government agencies, the United Nations could benefit from a fresh set of eyes"
"1039","haley"," I will take an outsider's look at the institution"
"1040","haley"," As I have in every challenge in my life, I will come to the U"
"1041","haley","N"
"1042","haley"," to work and to work smart"
"1043","haley"," I will bring a firm message to the U"
"1044","haley","N"
"1045","haley"," that U"
"1046","haley","S"
"1047","haley"," leadership is essential in the world, it is essential for the advancement of humanitarian goals, and for the advancement of America's national interests"
"1048","haley"," When America fails to lead, the world becomes a dangerous place"
"1049","haley"," And when the world becomes more dangerous, the American people become more vulnerable"
"1050","haley"," At the U"
"1051","haley","N"
"1052","haley",", as elsewhere, the United States is the indispensable voice of freedom"
"1053","haley"," It is time that we once again find that voice"
"1054","haley"," The job of U"
"1055","haley","N"
"1056","haley"," ambassador is different from being a governor, but there is one essential element of leadership that is the same, and that is accountability"
"1057","haley"," A leader must be accountable to the people she serves"
"1058","haley"," Should you confirm me as ambassador, I will be accountable, first and foremost to the people of the United States"
"1059","haley"," Mr"
"1060","haley"," Chairman, accountability means being honest with ourselves"
"1061","haley"," As I appear before you today, when we look at the United Nations, we see a checkered history"
"1062","haley"," The U"
"1063","haley","N"
"1064","haley"," and its specialized agencies have had numerous successes"
"1065","haley"," Its health and food programs have saved millions of lives"
"1066","haley"," Its weapons monitoring efforts have provided us with vital security information"
"1067","haley"," Its peacekeeping missions have, at times, performed valuable services"
"1068","haley"," However, any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with American national interests and American taxpayers"
"1069","haley"," Nowhere has the U"
"1070","haley","N"
"1071","haley","'s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias against our close ally Israel"
"1072","haley"," In the General Assembly session just completed, the U"
"1073","haley","N"
"1074","haley"," adopted 20 resolutions against Israel and only six targeting the rest of the world's countries combined"
"1075","haley"," In the past 10 years, the Human Rights Council has passed 62 resolutions condemning the reasonable actions Israel takes to defend its security"
"1076","haley"," Meanwhile the world's worst human rights abusers in Syria, Iran and North Korea received far fewer condemnations"
"1077","haley"," This cannot continue"
"1078","haley"," It is in this context that the events of December 23rd were so damaging"
"1079","haley"," Last month's passage of U"
"1080","haley","N"
"1081","haley"," Resolution 2334 was a terrible mistake, making a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians even harder to achieve"
"1082","haley"," The mistake was compounded by the location in which it took place, in light of the U"
"1083","haley","N"
"1084","haley","'s long history of anti-Israel bias"
"1085","haley"," I was the first governor in America to sign legislation combating the anti-Israel Boycott, Divest, and Sanction, or the BDS movement"
"1086","haley"," I will not go to New York and abstain when the U"
"1087","haley","N"
"1088","haley"," seeks to create an international environment that encourages boycotts of Israel"
"1089","haley"," In fact, I pledge to you this: I will never abstain when the United Nations takes any action that comes in direct conflict with the interests and values of the United States"
"1090","haley"," In the matter of human rights, Mr"
"1091","haley"," Chairman, whether it's the love of my family's and America's immigrant heritage, or the removal of a painful symbol of an oppressive past in South Carolina, I have a clear understanding that it is not acceptable to stay silent when our values are challenged"
"1092","haley"," I will be a strong voice for American principles and American interests, even if that is not what other U"
"1093","haley","N"
"1094","haley"," representatives want to hear"
"1095","haley"," The time has come for American strength once again"
"1096","haley"," There are other elements of accountability as well"
"1097","haley"," As governor, the South Carolina constitution required me to report annually to the people of my state on how their security and prosperity were being advanced by their government"
"1098","haley"," In fact, I gave that State of the State address just one week ago"
"1099","haley"," I was able to tell the citizens of South Carolina that we now invest more dollars in public education than ever before, that our reserves have doubled while our debt service has been cut in half, and more South Carolinians are working today than ever in the history of our state"
"1100","haley"," Without fundamental changes at the U"
"1101","haley","N"
"1102","haley",", I cannot envision making the same kind of report to the American people as their ambassador"
"1103","haley"," We contribute 22 percent of the U"
"1104","haley","N"
"1105","haley","'s budget, far more than any other country"
"1106","haley"," We are a generous nation"
"1107","haley"," But we must ask ourselves, what good is being accomplished by this disproportionate contribution? Are we getting what we pay for? To your credit, the Congress has already begun to explore ways the United States can use its leverage to make the United Nations a better investment for the American people"
"1108","haley"," I applaud your efforts and I look forward to working with you to bring seriously needed change to the U"
"1109","haley","N"
"1110","haley"," If I'm confirmed, I will need you and I hope to have your support"
"1111","haley"," In short, Mr"
"1112","haley"," Chairman, my goal for the United Nations will be to create an international body that better serves the interests of the American people"
"1113","haley"," After the passage of the infamous U"
"1114","haley","N"
"1115","haley"," resolution equating Zionism with racism in 1975, U"
"1116","haley","S"
"1117","haley"," Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan came to the unsettling realization that, as he put it, quote, ""If there were no General Assembly, this could never have happened"
"1118","haley",""" Today, over 40 years later, more and more Americans are becoming convinced by actions like the passage of Resolution 2334 that the United Nations does more harm than good"
"1119","haley"," The American people see the U"
"1120","haley","N"
"1121","haley","'s mistreatment of Israel, its failure to prevent the North Korean nuclear threat, its waste and corruption, and they are fed up"
"1122","haley"," My job -- our job -- is to reform the U"
"1123","haley","N"
"1124","haley"," in ways that rebuild the confidence of the American people"
"1125","haley"," We must build an international institution that honors America's commitment to freedom, democracy and human rights"
"1126","haley"," I hope this can be done"
"1127","haley"," I believe it is possible"
"1128","haley"," And I know that if you confirm me, I will do all I can to see that that happens"
"1129","haley"," Some say we live in cynical and distrustful times"
"1130","haley"," But I believe we all carry in our hearts a bit of idealism that animated the creation of the United Nations"
"1131","haley"," I know I do"
"1132","haley"," With your blessing, I will represent our great country in this international forum"
"1133","haley"," I will do it in ways that I hope bring honor to our country, our values and our national interests"
"1134","haley"," Thank you very much for your time"
"1135","gina haspel","Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner, members of the committee: Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today"
"1136","gina haspel"," I am here because I have been nominated to lead the extraordinary men and women at the Central Intelligence Agency � men and women who are our country�s silent warriors"
"1137","gina haspel"," These dedicated professionals spend much of their careers in difficult, far-flung outposts of the globe, striving to make our fellow Americans more secure at home"
"1138","gina haspel"," It has been the privilege of my professional life to be one of those CIA officers"
"1139","gina haspel"," Now, I have been asked by President Trump to lead this workforce and to continue the work that Mike Pompeo and I began a little more than a year ago: ensuring that CIA is postured to meet the complex challenges our nation faces"
"1140","gina haspel"," Those challenges include a changing but still lethal threat from terrorist groups; a nuclear threat against the continental United States from a rogue state; destabilizing Iranian adventurism; an aggressive and sometimes brutal Russia; and the long-term implications of China�s ambitions on the global stage"
"1141","gina haspel"," While these challenges are daunting and offer few easy answers, I am confident the United States and the American people have the resolve to meet them head on"
"1142","gina haspel"," If I am confirmed as Director, you have my solemn commitment that I will position this Agency to provide the intelligence support our country needs to meet the challenges of today, and those of the future"
"1143","gina haspel"," I welcome the opportunity to introduce myself to the American people for the first time � it is a new experience for me as I spent over 30 years under cover and in the shadows"
"1144","gina haspel"," I don�t have any social media accounts, but otherwise I think you will find me to be a typical middle class American � one with a strong sense of right and wrong and one who loves this country"
"1145","gina haspel"," I was born in Kentucky, and while my family has deep roots there, I was an Air Force �brat� and followed my father to postings all over the world"
"1146","gina haspel"," My childhood overseas instilled in me an appreciation for foreign languages and cultures, but also a deep understanding of the vital role of American leadership in confronting aggression abroad"
"1147","gina haspel"," I joined the CIA in 1985 as an operations officer in the Clandestine Service"
"1148","gina haspel"," From my first days in training, I had a knack for the nuts and bolts of my profession"
"1149","gina haspel"," I excelled in finding and acquiring secret information that I obtained in brush passes, dead drops, or in meetings in dusty back allies of third world capitals"
"1150","gina haspel"," I recall my first foreign agent meeting was on a dark, moonless night with an agent I�d never met before"
"1151","gina haspel"," When I picked him up, he passed me the intelligence and I passed him extra money for the men he led"
"1152","gina haspel"," It was the beginning of an adventure I had only dreamed of"
"1153","gina haspel"," The men who ran CIA in those days leaned forward in giving me the right opportunities to succeed or fail"
"1154","gina haspel"," When a very tough, old school leader announced that I was his pick to be Chief  2 of Station in a small but important frontier post, a few competitors complained to me directly �why would they send you?� I owe that leader much for believing in me at a time when few women were given these opportunities"
"1155","gina haspel"," While I could have done without the long nights, sleeping on the floor of my station, I was proud of the work we did there including the successful capture of two major terrorists, a counterproliferation operation that went our way, and the dismantlement of a local terrorist cell"
"1156","gina haspel"," Altogether, I have served seven tours in the field�four as Chief of Station�including hardship assignments in distant posts and, more recently, in the capital of a major US ally"
"1157","gina haspel"," By any standard, my life at the Agency � and it has been my life � has exceeded all of my expectations, from that January day when I took my oath to today"
"1158","gina haspel"," There were few senior women leading at CIA in those days, and we are stronger now because that picture is changing"
"1159","gina haspel"," I did my part � quietly and through hard work � to break down those barriers"
"1160","gina haspel"," And I was proud to be the first woman to serve as the number-two in the Clandestine Service"
"1161","gina haspel"," It is not my way to trumpet the fact that I am a woman up for the top job, but I would be remiss in not remarking on it � not least because of the outpouring of support from young women at CIA who consider it a good sign for their own prospects"
"1162","gina haspel"," My experience and success as an operations officer led to three leadership positions in the Clandestine Service, and one year ago, I was asked to serve as Deputy Director of CIA"
"1163","gina haspel"," The reaction of the workforce to a rare nomination of one of their own to be Director � someone who has been in the trenches with them � has been overwhelming"
"1164","gina haspel"," I am humbled by their confidence that I can successfully lead this Agency and inspired to work harder than ever to maintain that mutual trust"
"1165","gina haspel"," They know that I don�t need time to learn the business of what CIA does"
"1166","gina haspel"," I know CIA like the back of my hand"
"1167","gina haspel"," I know them, I know the threats we face, and I know what we need to be successful in our mission"
"1168","gina haspel"," I have played a leading role this past year in setting us on the right path and I intend on continuing on that path if I am confirmed as Director"
"1169","gina haspel"," Our strategy starts with strengthening our core business: collecting intelligence to help policymakers protect our country and advance American interests around the globe"
"1170","gina haspel"," It includes raising our investment against the most difficult intelligence gaps, putting more officers in the foreign field where our adversaries are, and emphasizing foreign language excellence"
"1171","gina haspel"," And, finally, it involves investing in our partnerships � both within the US Government and around the globe"
"1172","gina haspel"," We must do everything we can to follow through on these investments and to make CIA as effective as it can possibly be, because the American people deserve no less than CIA�s best effort"
"1173","gina haspel"," This is especially true when it comes to confronting threats from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China"
"1174","gina haspel"," Today, CIA officers are deployed across the globe, sometimes at significant personal  3 risk, collecting critical human and technical intelligence"
"1175","gina haspel"," I have spent my entire career driving operations and, if confirmed, I will be able to leverage that experience against these hard targets beginning on day one"
"1176","gina haspel"," I knew that accepting the president�s nomination would raise questions about CIA classified activities and my career at the Agency"
"1177","gina haspel"," I also understand that it is important for the American people to get to know me so they are able to judge my fitness for this position"
"1178","gina haspel"," So over the last few weeks, we have leaned forward to make more information about my professional record public"
"1179","gina haspel"," We have also shared details on every aspect of my career through classified channels with this Committee, as well as with the rest of the Senate"
"1180","gina haspel"," I think it is important to recall the context of those challenging times immediately following 9/11"
"1181","gina haspel"," For me, I had just returned to Washington from an overseas posting and I reported for duty the morning of 9/11"
"1182","gina haspel"," I knew in my gut when I saw the video of the first plane hitting the Tower in Manhattan that it was Bin Ladin"
"1183","gina haspel"," I got up from my desk and, like many others, walked over to the Counterterrorism Center and volunteered to help"
"1184","gina haspel"," I didn�t leave for three years"
"1185","gina haspel"," We worked seven days a week, and I even had friends who postponed weddings and having babies"
"1186","gina haspel"," The men and women of CIA were driven to prevent another attack"
"1187","gina haspel"," The first boots on the ground in Afghanistan were my colleagues"
"1188","gina haspel"," The first U"
"1189","gina haspel","S"
"1190","gina haspel"," casualty in Afghanistan was a CIA officer and it was CIA who identified and captured the mastermind of 9/11 in a brilliant operation"
"1191","gina haspel"," I am proud of our work during that time"
"1192","gina haspel"," The hard lessons we learned from that experience inform my leadership of CIA today"
"1193","gina haspel"," In light of my counterterrorism experience, I understand that what many people around the country want to know about are my views on CIA�s former detention and interrogation program"
"1194","gina haspel"," I have views on this issue, and I want to be clear"
"1195","gina haspel"," Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program"
"1196","gina haspel"," CIA has learned some tough lessons, especially when asked to tackle missions that fall outside our expertise"
"1197","gina haspel"," For me, there is no better example of implementing lessons learned than what the Agency took away from the detention and interrogation program"
"1198","gina haspel"," In retrospect it is clear, as the SSCI Majority Report concludes, that CIA was not prepared to conduct a detention and interrogation program"
"1199","gina haspel"," Today, the US Government has a clear legal and policy framework that governs detentions and interrogations"
"1200","gina haspel"," Specifically, the law provides that no individual in US custody may be subjected to any interrogation technique or approach that is not authorized by and listed in the Army Field Manual"
"1201","gina haspel"," I fully support the standards for detainee treatment required by law, and just as importantly, I will keep CIA focused on our collection and analysis missions that can best leverage the expertise found at the Agency"
"1202","gina haspel"," Like I said, we learned important lessons following 9/11"
"1203","gina haspel"," As both a career intelligence officer and an American citizen, I am a strong believer in the importance of oversight"
"1204","gina haspel"," Simply put, experience has taught us that CIA cannot be effective without the people�s trust"
"1205","gina haspel"," And we cannot hope to earn that trust without the accountability that comes with Congressional oversight"
"1206","gina haspel"," 4 If we can�t share aspects of our secret work with the public, we should do so with their elected representatives"
"1207","gina haspel"," For CIA, oversight is a vital link to the open society we defend"
"1208","gina haspel"," It�s a defining feature of the US Intelligence Community, and one of the many things that distinguishes us from the hostile services we face in the field"
"1209","gina haspel"," If confirmed as Director, I will uphold the Agency�s obligations to Congress and ensure that oversight works on behalf of the American people"
"1210","gina haspel"," Mr"
"1211","gina haspel"," Chairman, I want to thank you and the Committee for the hard work that is put into the oversight process, and for the vital support that you provide to my fellow officers"
"1212","gina haspel"," CIA has given a lot to me over the past three decades�a calling in service to my country, some real-life adventures, and the profound satisfaction of serving with some of the most talented and honorable men and women anyone could ever meet"
"1213","gina haspel"," If confirmed, I hope to repay the debt I owe to this remarkable Agency by drawing on my experience"
"1214","gina haspel"," I know what my fellow officers need from me and, I know what our nation needs from CIA�truth, integrity, and courage"
"1215","gina haspel"," Again, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to sit before you today, and I look forward to your questions"
"1216","mcmahon","Thank you, Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Shaheen, and members of the Committee"
"1217","mcmahon"," I'm honored to have your consideration to serve as head of the U"
"1218","mcmahon","S"
"1219","mcmahon"," Small Business Administration"
"1220","mcmahon"," I'd like to thank Senator Blumenthal and Senator Murphy for their kind introductions"
"1221","mcmahon"," I'd also like to express my gratitude to President Trump for this opportunity to join his Administration"
"1222","mcmahon"," As an entrepreneur myself, I have shared the experiences of our nation's small business owners"
"1223","mcmahon"," We are more than our products and services"
"1224","mcmahon"," We are people"
"1225","mcmahon"," We are families"
"1226","mcmahon"," The small businesses that are the engine of our national economy are driven in part by people working to put food on the table, pay for kids' braces and swimming lessons, save for college and prepare for their own retirement"
"1227","mcmahon"," Whether it's an organic farmer or an app developer, with one employee or a hundred, we can never forget that small businesses are people with goals and values that cannot be calculated just on a profit-and-loss statement"
"1228","mcmahon"," If I have the honor of being confirmed as the head of the SBA, I will do my best to advocate on their behalf"
"1229","mcmahon"," My husband and I built our business from scratch"
"1230","mcmahon"," We started out sharing a desk"
"1231","mcmahon"," Over decades of hard work and strategic growth, we built it into a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees"
"1232","mcmahon"," I am proud of our success - I know every bit of the hard work it took to create that success"
"1233","mcmahon"," I remember the early days when every month I had to decide whether I should continue to lease a typewriter or if I could finally afford to buy it"
"1234","mcmahon"," Yes, that $12 a month really made a difference in our budget"
"1235","mcmahon"," Uke all small business owners, I know what it's like to take a risk on an idea, manage cash flow, navigate regulations and tax laws, and create jobs"
"1236","mcmahon"," Since stepping down as CEO of WWE in 2009, I have worked to help more people have the opportunity to pursue those goals"
"1237","mcmahon"," In my travels throughout Connecticut in 2010 and 2012, I met with more than 500 small business owners - touring their shops, restaurants, offices and factories and sharing ideas during roundtable discussions"
"1238","mcmahon"," Job growth was a pillar of my campaign, and because small businesses are responsible for half of all private-sector jobs and the majority of new jobs, they were my focus"
"1239","mcmahon"," And for the past two years, I have promoted women in entrepreneurship as co-founder and CEO of a startup called Women's Leadership LIVE"
"1240","mcmahon"," I wanted to share my vast experience with others who are launching startups or looking to scale their businesses"
"1241","mcmahon"," Through live events and webinars, we educate entrepreneurs about things like applying for a loan and developing a business plan"
"1242","mcmahon"," We also work to build their confidence"
"1243","mcmahon"," I always say that even entrepreneurs with the best ideas sometimes need a little wind beneath their wings"
"1244","mcmahon"," Women's leadership LIVE hopes that by sharing our stories of successes and failures, our networks of contacts and resources, and our strategies for addressing challenges, we can give small business owners the confidence that will help propel them forward"
"1245","mcmahon"," Small business owners do not just need confidence in themselves; in order to take a risk, they need confidence in the economy"
"1246","mcmahon"," Should I have the honor of being confirmed to lead the SBA, I will work to revitalize a spirit of entrepreneurship in America"
"1247","mcmahon"," Small businesses want to feel they can take a risk on an expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable"
"1248","mcmahon"," We want to renew optimism in our economy"
"1249","mcmahon"," Small businesses have had some tough blows in the past decade"
"1250","mcmahon"," I know what it's like to take a hit, and I have learned it's not how you fall, but how you get up that truly matters"
"1251","mcmahon"," Early in my career, when we were very young, my husband and I declared bankruptcy"
"1252","mcmahon"," We invested in a company we didn't understand and trusted people we shouldn't have"
"1253","mcmahon"," When that company went under, we were left holding the bag"
"1254","mcmahon"," We worked really hard to pay off those debts until we realized we just couldn't"
"1255","mcmahon"," Bankruptcy was a really hard decision and a tough time in our lives"
"1256","mcmahon"," We lost our home"
"1257","mcmahon"," My car was repossessed in the driveway"
"1258","mcmahon"," We had a young son and a baby on the way"
"1259","mcmahon"," We had no choice but to work hard and start building again so we could support our family"
"1260","mcmahon"," When our daughter Stephanie was born - a perfect little baby so full of promise and potential-! took it as an omen that things were going to be okay"
"1261","mcmahon"," We owed it to her and to our son that we would make it okay"
"1262","mcmahon"," And fortunately, we did"
"1263","mcmahon"," As I visited small businesses all over the country through Women's leadership LIVE, I have seen that same resiliency over and over again"
"1264","mcmahon"," Entrepreneurs are fighters"
"1265","mcmahon"," They work hard, and when they get knocked down by a recession or a natural disaster or simply a change in consumer demand, they turn to their creativity to make it better"
"1266","mcmahon"," But sometimes they need a helping hand"
"1267","mcmahon"," If I am honored to be confirmed, I will work to guide SBA as that helping hand in the most efficient and effective way possible"
"1268","mcmahon"," I believe in leadership by example"
"1269","mcmahon"," As a CEO, I never expect employees to do anything I am not willing to do myself"
"1270","mcmahon"," I believe in setting expectations and holding people accountable, but trusting them to do the job for which they were hired"
"1271","mcmahon"," If confirmed, I look forward to working with the SBA staff"
"1272","mcmahon"," I am eager to learn from their experience and expertise"
"1273","mcmahon"," I will listen, and their ideas, concerns and recommendations will be taken seriously"
"1274","mcmahon"," I know there will be new challenges in a government setting, but I will commit myself with the same responsibility to deliver value to the taxpayers of America as I did to the shareholders of my company"
"1275","mcmahon"," Over the past two weeks I have had the pleasure of meeting with many members of the Committee, and I appreciate the kind words of encouragement I have received"
"1276","mcmahon"," Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today"
"1277","mcmahon"," I am happy to take your questions"
"1278","mcmahon","  "
"1279","coats","Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner, Members of the Committee � I am honored to appear before you as the nominee for the position of Director of National Intelligence"
"1280","coats"," It was a great privilege of mine to have served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and to see up close the great work done by all of the Members and staff"
"1281","coats"," I�ll admit, however, the view is a little bit different down here than it was up there"
"1282","coats"," I�d like to begin by thanking President Trump for nominating me for the position of Director of National Intelligence � I am humbled by his confidence in me, and will work tirelessly to lead the world�s finest intelligence enterprise"
"1283","coats"," I would also like to thank Vice President Pence, my Indiana colleague and someone I�m honored to call my friend, for his support"
"1284","coats"," I�m proud to have worked with him for so long, and deeply appreciate his faith in me"
"1285","coats"," Senator Chambliss, thank you for being here to introduce me today"
"1286","coats"," We served together in the Senate, and I particularly enjoyed working alongside you in your leadership role of this Committee"
"1287","coats"," I�m honored by your kind introduction and presence here today, and for the friendship you and your wife, Julianne, have provided to my wife, Marsha, and me over the years � Saxby, thank you"
"1288","coats"," I�d also like to acknowledge the work of the previous DNI, Jim Clapper, and his Principal Deputy, Stephanie O�Sullivan"
"1289","coats"," Their stewardship of the Intelligence Community over the past years has been commendable, and their guidance in helping me prepare for this position has been invaluable"
"1290","coats"," They left in place an experienced and great team who have been instrumental in providing a smooth transition for the ODNI and the IC"
"1291","coats"," Also, I want to recognize my fellow Hoosiers who elected me to the House and Senate over the past years"
"1292","coats"," I have always done my best to represent them, and am honored by the confidence they put in me time and again"
"1293","coats"," While I�ll always be a Hoosier at heart, if confirmed as the next Director of National Intelligence, I will represent the dedicated men and women of the ODNI and the broader IC to the best of my ability"
"1294","coats","  2 Finally, and saving the best for last, I would like to thank my wife Marsha and children Laura, Lisa, and Andrew"
"1295","coats"," Together my three children have produced 10 perfect grandchildren"
"1296","coats"," My career in public service is a direct reflection of their enduring support and love"
"1297","coats"," Without their encouragement, I wouldn�t be sitting before you today"
"1298","coats"," It has been a long road of public service that has brought me here before you"
"1299","coats"," After 34 years of service in the House, Senate, and as US Ambassador to Germany, I was ready to make a transition and planned to move on to a new chapter of my lifelong journey back home again in Indiana"
"1300","coats"," But as I have learned over those 34 years, life doesn�t always work out that way"
"1301","coats"," When called upon to consider this position, I first consulted my most important advisor � my wife, Marsha � as I examined the responsibilities of such a significant Office"
"1302","coats"," As a former teacher and family therapist, Marsha understands me and the importance of public service"
"1303","coats"," She is the rock that provides stability and wise counsel, shoulder to shoulder with me in every aspect of my life"
"1304","coats"," While I am no longer retiring from public service, what I AM retiring is my policy hat � a hat I wore proudly for years as I represented the views of my constituents, offered policy proposals, and cast votes in Committee and on the floor"
"1305","coats"," Just as this government transitions to new leadership, I too hope to transition to the role of principal intelligence advisor to the President"
"1306","coats"," In this new role, it will be my responsibility to present the President, senior policymakers throughout the Administration, and you the Congress, with the best and most objective, nonpolitical, and timely intelligence as you consider policies and the future of our great Nation"
"1307","coats"," The President and I have discussed my potential role as his principal intelligence advisor, and we both recognize that this position is frequently the bearer of unpleasant news"
"1308","coats"," But if confirmed, my responsibility would be to provide him with the most accurate and objective intelligence possible"
"1309","coats"," In my various conversations with many of you prior to this hearing, I was asked about how I see my role as the DNI"
"1310","coats"," Those that know me know that I�m an avid sports fan�never more avid than this past year as I celebrated the seemingly impossible accomplishment of the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series"
"1311","coats"," So allow me to compare how I see my role as the DNI using, well not a baseball but rather a football analogy"
"1312","coats"," On a football team, the players are guided by a variety of coaches"
"1313","coats"," There�s a coach for the offense, one for the defense, one for special teams, one each for offensive and defensive linemen, one for quarterbacks, and several others"
"1314","coats","  3 But every team has a head coach � that leader who walks the sidelines and, while not dictating to each coach how to do their specific job, pulls each of those specialists together to form a seamless and focused team"
"1315","coats"," I see the role of the Director of National Intelligence as analogous to this head coach role for the Intelligence Community � integrating the IC and leveraging all of the expertise in our Community"
"1316","coats"," We have immense talent resident in the many agencies across the IC, and each one contributes unique capabilities or expertise that is necessary for the team as a whole to be successful"
"1317","coats"," _ The unique access of our human intelligence sources and the detailed analysis from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency; _ The signals intelligence expertise of the National Security Agency is second to none; _ The geospatial mastery demonstrated by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency; _ The acquisition proficiency of our satellite specialists at the National Reconnaissance Office; _ The force multiplier the intelligence elements of the Armed Services bring to this team effort; _ The domestic counterterrorism and counterintelligence work done by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; _ And the specialized skills of the IC elements resident within the Departments of State, Treasury, Justice, Homeland Security, and Energy"
"1318","coats"," Like a head coach, I see it as my job to pull all of these team members together under the same game plan to produce the best coordinated and integrated intelligence"
"1319","coats"," To make the whole greater than the sum of the parts"
"1320","coats"," Given the complicated threat environment that we face today in this country and around the world, now more than ever, the IC must work as a team"
"1321","coats"," Seamless"
"1322","coats"," The threats that we face today are more challenging, dynamic, and geographically diffuse than ever before"
"1323","coats"," Allow me to address, in no particular order, what I see as some of the most challenging issues we currently face: _ Clearly the rising cyber threat must be highlighted"
"1324","coats"," Cyberspace is both a resource and a liability; an increasingly connected world creates tremendous opportunities, but also many vulnerabilities"
"1325","coats"," _ Not unrelated, I would also highlight the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, which continues to be a significant threat to the United States and its allies abroad"
"1326","coats"," They�re spreading their message of fear and hate through cyber space, and mobilizing to venues beyond their self-described caliphate"
"1327","coats"," 4 _ China�s continued regional activism, including its disputed territorial claims in the East and South China Seas, is troubling, and will be a long-term challenge"
"1328","coats"," _ Russia�s assertiveness in global affairs is something I look upon with great concern, which we need to address with eyes wide open and a healthy degree of skepticism"
"1329","coats"," _ And North Korea�s nuclear ambitions and, quite frankly, provocations, are something the intelligence community needs to be laser-focused on"
"1330","coats"," The list continues with a diverse set of challenges�including those in Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, and other hot spots around the world"
"1331","coats"," In order to address these threats, I will bring my many years of experience in how to execute on a plan, and bring together teams of people toward a common goal"
"1332","coats"," As Ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005, I oversaw the activity of nearly two dozen agencies at the American embassy"
"1333","coats"," I trust that my experiences coordinating and integrating that many different departments and agencies, overseeing their activities, leveraging their strengths, and bringing them together under a single strategy will serve me well as DNI"
"1334","coats"," As a Member of Congress in both the House and Senate, I have always had a keen interest in ensuring we are responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars"
"1335","coats"," In evaluating federal programs, I always made a point to ask questions about what works, what doesn�t work, and why"
"1336","coats"," I also believed it was important to assess how we establish priorities"
"1337","coats"," We must ask ourselves: in a time of tightened budgets, what programs are truly essential, and which may no longer be necessary, or of lower priority? How does each program support our overall goal or strategy? And is it duplicative of another effort? I will be looking to ask the IC these and many more questions if confirmed as the DNI"
"1338","coats"," And in the vein of efficiency, there has been much discussion about the role of the DNI, and the Office of the DNI"
"1339","coats"," Let me share with you what I have learned in preparation for this opportunity"
"1340","coats"," Over the past 12 years since its inception, the ODNI has been tasked with a variety of responsibilities � in statute, in Executive Orders, and in Presidential Memoranda, along with recommendations coming from the 9/11 Commission and Silberman/Robb Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction"
"1341","coats"," The people supporting these directives are hardworking folks from all across the IC"
"1342","coats"," Of note, a significant portion of the ODNI�s workforce is on rotation from other IC agencies"
"1343","coats"," ODNI was established to counter the pre-9/11 stove-piping by individual intelligence agencies, and ensure collaboration and integration across the intelligence elements"
"1344","coats"," 5 ODNI brings together talent from across the Community to integrate intelligence and does its best to connect all dots � not just specific dots from specific agencies and specialties"
"1345","coats"," In keeping with my earlier football analogy, you can�t play a complete game with just a star quarterback and wide receiver�well maybe the New England Patriots can"
"1346","coats"," But even the Pats need a strong offensive line, a stout defense, agile special teams, and a talented place kicker � along with many other players"
"1347","coats"," Not every player on a football team is going to be the MVP, but they are a team nonetheless, and everyone on the field plays a critical role"
"1348","coats"," And when we win, we win as a team"
"1349","coats"," I�ve also been asked about the size of the Office of the DNI, and whether it�s too large"
"1350","coats"," As I looked at the many requirements of the Office reflected in various laws, orders, and recommendations, I�ve been impressed by the Office�s responsiveness to these many tasks within reasonable resources"
"1351","coats"," Recent commentary on the size of the ODNI doesn�t mesh well with what I�ve seen first-hand, and I believe it does a disservice to this committee and your efforts to keep the size of the ODNI in check"
"1352","coats"," That said, and as I discussed earlier, I believe every government agency must constantly review its operations, and I�ll be taking a look at not only the Office of the DNI, but the entire IC, and at how we can do things most efficiently and effectively"
"1353","coats"," Much has been made publicly about the role of our Intelligence enterprise, and how it will fare in the future"
"1354","coats"," And I am encouraged by what I see"
"1355","coats"," With the leadership team in place at the IC agencies, I know that this Community will continue as the world class intelligence enterprise that it is today"
"1356","coats"," Before going to questions, I�d like to share with you the early goals that, if confirmed, I will share with the IC"
"1357","coats"," I intend to push the IC to be the best it can be, and not accept the status quo when it comes to the challenges facing our nation"
"1358","coats"," I intend to ask the IC to be innovative in its approach to hard problems and the solutions to solve them"
"1359","coats"," I intend to be a champion for the hardworking men and women of the IC � to be there for them the way they are here for all of us"
"1360","coats"," Every day, the men and women of the IC are working tirelessly on the front lines � often times in shadows, often times in very dangerous situations � with the common goal of keeping America safe and secure"
"1361","coats","  6 I also intend to work with all of you to ensure that the IC has the support it needs to tackle whatever the opposing teams bring our way, and to ensure that the Congress and this Committee have access to the information they need to conduct their oversight responsibilities"
"1362","coats"," I am honored by the opportunity to be here with you today, and I thank you for your consideration of my nomination"
"1363","coats"," And with that, I look forward to answering your questions"
"1364","coats"," "
"1365","wilbur ross","Mr"
"1366","wilbur ross"," Chairman, Ranking Member Nelson, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today"
"1367","wilbur ross"," As a proud resident of Florida I am honored by the presence of both of my home State Senators, and I would also like to thank Senator Marco Rubio for his kind introduction"
"1368","wilbur ross"," With me today is my wife, Hilary Geary Ross"
"1369","wilbur ross"," Since President-elect Trump announced my nomination, I�ve had the opportunity to meet with many of you"
"1370","wilbur ross"," In our meetings, I�ve heard firsthand how we can work together on behalf of the American people"
"1371","wilbur ross"," These meetings have been helpful to me"
"1372","wilbur ross"," I look forward to our continued dialog"
"1373","wilbur ross"," Mr"
"1374","wilbur ross"," Chairman, I am honored to be under consideration for Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce"
"1375","wilbur ross"," I�m particularly interested in the Department of Commerce for several reasons"
"1376","wilbur ross"," First, I may be the only nominee for Secretary of Commerce that was a U"
"1377","wilbur ross","S"
"1378","wilbur ross"," Census Taker"
"1379","wilbur ross"," I was working my way through Harvard Business School and that was one of the jobs that I had during college"
"1380","wilbur ross"," At that time, we would put on the big white sash along with a badge and we would visit individual homes and record information for the Census"
"1381","wilbur ross"," I was assigned to Scollay Square in Boston"
"1382","wilbur ross"," We had to convince people through a small opening of the door that we were helping record an accurate count"
"1383","wilbur ross"," So I have some personal experience with the Census � a very important function within the Department of Commerce"
"1384","wilbur ross"," Second, like many other business people across the United States, I have been a consumer of the data and information the Department provides a periodic basis"
"1385","wilbur ross"," Data the Department gathers and makes public, such as the Census data, the data that the BEA puts out and NOAA�s reports, to name a few, are essential functions"
"1386","wilbur ross"," I believe there is greater potential in the breadth and the depth of the data the Department provides to encourage new investment"
"1387","wilbur ross"," 2 Third, in terms of telecommunications, the Department auctions spectrum and helps bring access to broadband to communities nationwide"
"1388","wilbur ross"," In some small way I have direct experience with broadband deployment"
"1389","wilbur ross"," Before this nomination, I was the vice chair of the Utilities Undergrounding Task Force where I live in Southern Florida"
"1390","wilbur ross"," The Task Force is eager to move to fiber optics and telecommunications to our community"
"1391","wilbur ross"," In order to do so the Task Force had to do it in way that was not damaging to the Everglades"
"1392","wilbur ross"," That brings me to NOAA"
"1393","wilbur ross"," Living on the coast in Southern Florida, we are all very sensitive to weather because of the yearly hurricane season"
"1394","wilbur ross"," So weather information is critical to us, like so many communities across the United States"
"1395","wilbur ross"," I am also well aware of the importance of the fishing industry and tourism to coastal economies, so I am looking forward to the individual issues on those matters that fall within the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce"
"1396","wilbur ross"," And then there is trade"
"1397","wilbur ross"," I�ve made my livelihood for over five decades dealing in international commerce"
"1398","wilbur ross"," My companies have operated on the ground in some 23 countries around the world"
"1399","wilbur ross"," Sometimes those operations have progressed happily, sometimes a lot less happily"
"1400","wilbur ross"," I�ve also been in the middle of complicated situations in our domestic manufacturing sector and being subjected to some of the bad trade activities of other countries, both in terms of non-tariff trade barriers that some countries impose on us and state subsidies of foreign exports coming into the United States"
"1401","wilbur ross"," I think I�ve probably had more direct experience than any prior Cabinet nominee has had with unfair trade in the steel business, in the textile business, in the auto parts business and other sectors"
"1402","wilbur ross"," I am very well aware of the issues many companies face and I�m sensitive to both the issues abroad and the issues here at home"
"1403","wilbur ross"," While I have worked with many people across many lands, the thing I�m proudest about in my whole career is working with Leo Gerard, the President of the United Steel Workers of America, and other unions in saving the American steel industry"
"1404","wilbur ross"," Working together we were able to save thousands of jobs and ensure this important industry continued in the United States"
"1405","wilbur ross"," I also understand that at the end of the day, each of our trading partners want access to our market"
"1406","wilbur ross"," The United States should provide that access to nations who agree to play by our  3 standards of fair trade"
"1407","wilbur ross"," We should not put up with malicious trading activities, state owned enterprises, or subsidized production"
"1408","wilbur ross"," So I am not anti-trade"
"1409","wilbur ross"," I am pro trade"
"1410","wilbur ross"," But I am pro sensible trade, not trade that is detrimental to the American worker and to the domestic manufacturing base"
"1411","wilbur ross"," During these past few weeks, President-elect Trump has met with many business leaders from across many industries"
"1412","wilbur ross"," I have attended many of the meetings"
"1413","wilbur ross"," One of the meetings was with leaders from the tech industry"
"1414","wilbur ross"," I was amazed how similar the problems they are facing, both in terms of trying to compete in foreign jurisdictions and competition coming in from abroad, are to the problems faced by more traditional industries like steel and textiles"
"1415","wilbur ross"," The techniques and products of the tech industry are different but the nature of the adverse trade activities they face are very similar to those experienced by the industries I�ve worked in for many years"
"1416","wilbur ross"," The Department serves many more functions, and I very much look forward to helping the American entrepreneur, the American worker, and American companies both big and small drive this economy forward and to create jobs"
"1417","wilbur ross"," I want to thank my wife for supporting my decision to enter public service, and to thank you once again for the opportunity to be here in front of this Committee"
"1418","wilbur ross"," If confirmed I look forward to working with you and with the many dedicated public servants at the Department of Commerce"
"1419","wilbur ross"," I look forward to your questions"
"1420","mattis","Thank you Mr"
"1421","mattis"," Chairman"
"1422","mattis"," It is an honor to come before you for this confirmation hearing as the President-elect�s nominee for the position of Secretary of Defense"
"1423","mattis"," I want to thank you, Mr"
"1424","mattis"," Chairman, Ranking Member Reed, and the members of this committee for taking time to see me during my courtesy calls � and I thank you for your willingness to accommodate this hearing and consider my nomination"
"1425","mattis"," I have testified previously in front of this committee and I have always held it in the highest regard"
"1426","mattis"," I wish to thank former Senator William Cohen for so kindly introducing me this morning"
"1427","mattis"," I�m grateful to the long-serving former chairman of this committee, Senator Sam Nunn, for his strong support"
"1428","mattis"," It is humbling to be considered for this position, and I thank the President-elect for placing his trust and confidence in me"
"1429","mattis"," I did not anticipate this request"
"1430","mattis"," When the call came from New York, I had a full life west of the Rockies"
"1431","mattis"," I was not involved in the presidential campaign and I was certainly not seeking or envisioning a position in any new administration"
"1432","mattis"," I relished my military career but never imagined further government service"
"1433","mattis"," That said, it would be my highest honor, if I am confirmed, to lead those who volunteer to defend our country"
"1434","mattis"," Military service is a touchstone for American patriots of all races, genders, and creeds"
"1435","mattis"," The men and women of the Department of Defense � military and civilian � reflect the diverse, non-partisan, and selfless character of our national defense"
"1436","mattis"," They do their duty, and they honor all the previous generations of veterans and civil servants who have served and sacrificed for our country"
"1437","mattis"," And they return to private life as better citizens and even more grateful for what America represents in this world"
"1438","mattis"," I know the Senators of this committee are well aware of the many global security challenges we face"
"1439","mattis"," We see each day a world awash in change; our country is still at war in Afghanistan and our troops are fighting against ISIS and other terrorist groups in the Middle East and elsewhere"
"1440","mattis"," Russia is raising grave concerns on several fronts and China is shredding trust along its periphery"
"1441","mattis"," Increasingly, we see islands of stability in our hemisphere, in Europe, and in Asia under attack by non-state actors and nations that mistakenly see their security in the insecurity of others"
"1442","mattis"," We find ourselves embracing the dual reality of seeking engagement and cooperation where we can, yet defending our interests where we must"
"1443","mattis"," While our military maintains capable land, air, and sea forces, the cyber and space domains now demand an increasing share of our attention and investment"
"1444","mattis"," These realities represent the  prominent challenges facing our military and the gravity of my leadership task if you choose to confirm me"
"1445","mattis"," Our Armed Forces must remain the best led, best equipped, and most ready force in the world"
"1446","mattis"," There is no room for complacency and we have no God-given right to victory on the battlefield"
"1447","mattis"," The reset of our force has been inadequate: our military gear is heavily used and it has not been properly and fully reconstituted following 15 years of deployment and conflict"
"1448","mattis"," Maintenance has been insufficient: if we do not maintain our gear, the money we spend on acquisition is wasted and we will have a hollow force"
"1449","mattis"," Future readiness is achieved through modernization, and that too has languished and is paying the price of sequestration"
"1450","mattis"," These demanding times require us to put together a strong national security team here in Washington and to work closely with our allies"
"1451","mattis"," If confirmed, I will lead the Department of Defense and be a forthright member of that team"
"1452","mattis"," I will be an advocate for our military, which is the envy of the world and represents America�s awesome determination to defend herself; I will be an advocate for the President-elect�s vision of a strengthened national security stance; and I recognize that I will need to be the strongest possible advocate for military and civilian personnel and their families, as we work to keep alive our experiment in democracy"
"1453","mattis"," If confirmed, I will foster an atmosphere of harmony and trust at the Department of Defense and with our interagency counterparts"
"1454","mattis"," The defense of our country is neither partisan nor personal, rather it is collaborative; vigorous debate in private is to be expected, and the process of sorting out competing views is often untidy yet necessary to craft ultimately a coherent strategy with bipartisan support and cooperation across the government and with our allies"
"1455","mattis"," We must integrate our global and regional strategies so that our response to each immediate, vexing issue does not plant the seed of a new, more dangerous problem"
"1456","mattis"," As swiftly as the President-elect�s national security team is confirmed, I will work to make sure the strategy and military calculus are employed so that we reinforce traditional tools of diplomacy, ensuring our President and our diplomats negotiate from a position of strength"
"1457","mattis"," Our recent experiences have reminded us that we should engage more using all components of our national power, and use military force only when it is in the vital interest of the United States, when other elements of national power have been insufficient in protecting our national interests, and generally as a last resort"
"1458","mattis"," In addition to ensuring collaboration across government and the adoption of an integrated strategy, we must also embrace our international alliances and security partnerships"
"1459","mattis"," History is clear: nations with strong allies thrive and those without them wither"
"1460","mattis"," Strengthening our alliances requires finding common cause, even with imperfect partners; taking no ally for granted; and living up to our treaty obligations"
"1461","mattis"," When America gives its word, it must mean what it says"
"1462","mattis"," We must also promote and enlist commensurate support from all our allies"
"1463","mattis"," The American taxpayer should not carry a disproportionate part of our shared defense, and all who benefit should be expected to help carry their part of the burden"
"1464","mattis"," If confirmed, my watchwords will be solvency and security in providing for the protection of our people and the survival of our freedoms"
"1465","mattis"," My priorities as Secretary of Defense will be to strengthen military readiness, principally by increasing the lethality of the force; to strengthen our alliances in league with our diplomatic partners by collaborating with allies whenever and wherever possible; and to bring business reforms to the Department of Defense by instilling budget discipline and holding our leaders accountable"
"1466","mattis"," All personnel policies will be designed to bring troops home alive and victorious"
"1467","mattis"," I will be committed to earning the trust and confidence of the Congress � and the American people � that the Department is the best possible steward of taxpayer money"
"1468","mattis"," The Department must now look across components and organizations to inform a strategic and realistic plan of potential reforms"
"1469","mattis"," It is imperative to disaggregate functions that add value, including those that increase the lethality of the force and help the Department achieve its aims, from functions that are duplicative and unnecessary"
"1470","mattis"," If confirmed, I will support the President-elect�s stated aim and work in concert with congressional leaders to invest in defense and remove the practice known as sequestration"
"1471","mattis"," I strongly support the Congress working to restore its active oversight role instead of continuing to rely on the non-strategic and self-destructive cuts imposed by sequestration"
"1472","mattis"," Working with Congress I will endeavor to keep our unique All-Volunteer Force secondto-none"
"1473","mattis"," We need to open the door to all who are eligible and wish to serve; provide them with the training, equipment, and confidence that are essential to their success; and ensure all service members are treated with dignity and respect"
"1474","mattis"," Our leaders at all levels of the chain of command will be accountable to ensure that each member of the Armed Forces has the opportunity to excel in an environment that maximizes their talents and has no patience for those who would degrade or diminish any person�s service"
"1475","mattis"," Today over 15 percent of today�s active-duty force is female"
"1476","mattis"," Our military could not accomplish its missions without these women"
"1477","mattis"," As we ask more from our female enlisted members and officers, we owe them more as well"
"1478","mattis"," The rate of sexual assault and harassment in the military is not acceptable"
"1479","mattis"," If I am confirmed, I will continue the Department�s focus on sexual assault prevention and response, and I will work with the committee to deal with this problem more effectively"
"1480","mattis"," The Department must do more to ensure service members can report any crime, including a crime involving sexual assault, without any fear of retaliation"
"1481","mattis"," Any organization needs to get its strategic vision right, and if I am confirmed, my strategic aim will be three-pronged: we will first maintain a safe and secure nuclear deterrent � because we must ensure a war that can never be won will never be fought"
"1482","mattis"," Second, we will field a decisive conventional force � because as expensive as it is to sustain such a force, it is far less costly in lives and treasure than a conventional war that we are unable to deter because we are seen as weak"
"1483","mattis"," Third, we will retain irregular warfare as a core competency of our Armed Forces � to ensure we can fight across the full spectrum of war"
"1484","mattis"," We will compose our forces accordingly"
"1485","mattis"," I recognize my potential civilian role differs in essence and in substance from my former role in uniform"
"1486","mattis"," While serving in uniform I obeyed civilian leadership while demonstrating loyalty to the U"
"1487","mattis","S"
"1488","mattis"," Constitution"
"1489","mattis"," In addition to my combat, joint, and NATO roles while in uniform, I served as the Executive Secretary to Secretaries of Defense Bill Perry and Bill Cohen in the mid-to-late-1990s and Senior Military Assistant to Deputy Secretaries of Defense Rudy de Leon and Paul Wolfowitz before 9/11"
"1490","mattis"," Those assignments allowed me to observe and support the civilian decision-making process at the most senior levels of the Department"
"1491","mattis"," Civilian control of the military is a fundamental tenet of the American military tradition"
"1492","mattis"," From day one service members swear an oath to support and defend the U"
"1493","mattis","S"
"1494","mattis"," Constitution; they see photos of the nation�s civilian leaders prominently displayed above their uniformed leadership; and they are imbued with the principle that our nation�s elected and appointed leaders control the use of our military"
"1495","mattis"," It is a hallmark of America�s military that service members take pride in our country�s adherence to that principle, and it is a hallmark espoused by every U"
"1496","mattis","S"
"1497","mattis"," military leader I have observed"
"1498","mattis"," The President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief and he alone is accountable to the American people for the outcomes of our integrated diplomatic, economic, and security decisions"
"1499","mattis"," The Secretary of Defense is the principal assistant to the President in all matters related to the Department of Defense"
"1500","mattis"," Both the Commanderin-Chief and the Secretary of Defense must impose an objective strategic calculus in the national security decision-making process and effectively direct its activities"
"1501","mattis"," They must ensure our nation takes the grave step of using force only when other non-military means have failed; when a defined and achievable political end-state is determined; and when our nation commits full resources to the fight"
"1502","mattis"," Civilian leaders bear these responsibilities because the esprit-de-corps of our military, its can-do spirit, and its obedience to civilian leadership reduces the inclination and power of the military to criticize or oppose the policy it is ultimately ordered to implement"
"1503","mattis"," If I am confirmed, the President-elect and his national security team will receive my full support, and the support of the Department of Defense, in the formulation of policy and the development of military options to implement that policy"
"1504","mattis"," If the Senate consents and if the full Congress passes an exception to the seven-year requirement, I will provide strong civilian leadership of military plans and decisions"
"1505","mattis"," I will insist unfiltered military advice is presented in full"
"1506","mattis"," And I will hold senior military and  civilian leaders accountable for performance"
"1507","mattis"," I know what to expect from uniformed leadership in interactions with the Department�s civilian leadership"
"1508","mattis"," I recognize under the Constitution it is the Congress that raises, sustains, and supports our Armed Forces through annual authorizations and appropriations"
"1509","mattis"," For many years I have watched you in action and testified before you and I look forward to collaborating closely for the defense of our nation"
"1510","mattis"," Having been nominated for this position, I am mindful of the extraordinary privilege it is to serve alongside so many service members and civilians of the Department of Defense"
"1511","mattis"," I will hold them and their families foremost in my thoughts and work to give them the best chance for victory if you confirm me"
"1512","mattis"," Finally, on a personal note, I have worked at the Pentagon twice in my career"
"1513","mattis"," But few people may know I am not the first person in my family to do so"
"1514","mattis"," When, in the wartime spring of 1942, my mother was 20 years old and working in military intelligence, she was part of the first wave of government employees to move into the still-unfinished Pentagon"
"1515","mattis"," She had come to America as an infant and lives today on the banks of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest"
"1516","mattis"," Little could she imagine in her youth that more than 90 years after she immigrated to this country, and 75 years after she first walked through the doors of the War Department, one of her sons would be sitting here today before the Senate"
"1517","mattis"," "
"1518","sessions","Thank you Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner for allowing me to publicly appear before the committee today"
"1519","sessions"," I appreciate the Committee's critically important efforts to investigate Russian interference with our democratic process"
"1520","sessions"," Such interference can never be tolerated and I encourage every effort to get to the bottom of any such allegations"
"1521","sessions"," As you know, the Deputy Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate matters related to Russian interference in the 2016 election"
"1522","sessions"," I am here today to address several issues that have been specifically raised before this committee, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to questions as fully as I am able to do so"
"1523","sessions"," But as I advised you, Mr"
"1524","sessions"," Chairman, and consistent with long-standing Department of Justice practice, I cannot and will not violate my duty to protect confidential communications with the President"
"1525","sessions"," Now, let me address some issues directly: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel"
"1526","sessions"," I did not attend any meetings at that event"
"1527","sessions"," Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump"
"1528","sessions"," Though I do recall several conversations I had during that pre-speech reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials"
"1529","sessions"," If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it"
"1530","sessions"," After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel"
"1531","sessions"," But whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns"
"1532","sessions"," Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election"
"1533","sessions"," Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign"
"1534","sessions"," I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie"
"1535","sessions"," Relatedly, there is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Franken's question honestly at my confirmation hearing"
"1536","sessions"," That is false"
"1537","sessions"," This is how it happened"
"1538","sessions"," He asked me a rambling question that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community had advised President-elect Trump that ""there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government"
"1539","sessions",""" I was taken aback by these explosive allegations, which he said were being reported in breaking news that day"
"1540","sessions"," I wanted to refute immediately any suggestion that I was a part of such an activity"
"1541","sessions"," I replied, ""Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities"
"1542","sessions"," I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have -- did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it"
"1543","sessions",""" That was the context in which I was asked the question, and in that context, my answer was a fair and correct response to the charge as I understood it"
"1544","sessions"," It simply did not occur to me to go further than the context of the question and list any conversations I may have had with Russians in routine situations, as I had with numerous other foreign officials"
"1545","sessions"," Please hear me now"
"1546","sessions"," It was only in March of this year that a reporter asked my spokesperson whether I had ever met with any Russian officials"
"1547","sessions"," This was the first time that question had been posed"
"1548","sessions"," On the same day, we provided that reporter with the information related to the meeting I and my staff had held in my Senate office with Ambassador Kislyak, as well as the brief encounter in July after a speech that I had given during the convention in Cleveland, Ohio"
"1549","sessions"," I also provided the reporter a list of all 25 foreign ambassador meetings I had held during 2016"
"1550","sessions"," In addition, I provided supplemental testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain this"
"1551","sessions"," I readily acknowledged these two meetings"
"1552","sessions"," Certainly nothing improper occurred"
"1553","sessions"," Let me also explain clearly the circumstances of my recusal from the investigation into the Russian interference with the 2016 election"
"1554","sessions"," I was sworn in as Attorney General on Thursday, February 9th"
"1555","sessions"," The very next day, I met with career Department officials, including a senior ethics official, to discuss some things publicly reported in the press and that might have some bearing on the issue of recusal"
"1556","sessions"," From that point, February 10th, until I announced my formal recusal on March 2nd, I was never briefed on any investigative details and did not access information about the investigation; I received only the limited information that the Department's career officials determined was necessary to inform my recusal decision"
"1557","sessions"," As such, I have no knowledge about this investigation beyond what has been publicly reported, and I have taken no action with regard to any such investigation"
"1558","sessions"," On the date of my formal recusal, my Chief of Staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to Director Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters"
"1559","sessions"," And in fact, they have not"
"1560","sessions"," Importantly, I recused myself not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign, but because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45"
"1561","sessions","2, required it"
"1562","sessions"," That regulation states, in effect, that Department employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign advisor"
"1563","sessions"," The scope of my recusal, however, does not and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35,000 employees"
"1564","sessions"," I presented to the President my concerns, and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr"
"1565","sessions"," Comey along with the Deputy Attorney General's memorandum, which have been released publicly by the White House"
"1566","sessions"," It is a clear statement of my views"
"1567","sessions"," It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render an Attorney General unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations"
"1568","sessions"," Finally, during his testimony, Mr"
"1569","sessions"," Comey discussed a conversation he and I had about a meeting Mr"
"1570","sessions"," Comey had with the President"
"1571","sessions"," I am happy to share with the committee my recollection of the conversation I had with Mr"
"1572","sessions"," Comey"
"1573","sessions"," Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr"
"1574","sessions"," Comey spoke to me and my Chief of Staff"
"1575","sessions"," While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the President, Mr"
"1576","sessions"," Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the President"
"1577","sessions"," I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow Department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House"
"1578","sessions"," Mr"
"1579","sessions"," Comey had served in the Department of Justice for the better part of two decades, and I was confident that Mr"
"1580","sessions"," Comey understood and would abide by the Department's well-established rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations"
"1581","sessions"," My comments encouraged him to do just that and indeed, as I understand, he did"
"1582","sessions"," Our Department of Justice rules on proper communication between the Department and the White House have been in place for years"
"1583","sessions"," Mr"
"1584","sessions"," Comey well knew them, I thought, and assumed correctly that he complied with them"
"1585","sessions"," I will finish with this"
"1586","sessions"," I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations"
"1587","sessions"," At all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming Attorney General, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards"
"1588","sessions"," The people of this country expect an honest and transparent government and that is what we are giving them"
"1589","sessions"," This President wants to focus on the people of this country to ensure they are treated fairly and kept safe"
"1590","sessions"," The Trump agenda is to improve the lives of the American people"
"1591","sessions"," I know some have other agendas, but that is his agenda and it is one I share"
"1592","sessions"," Importantly, as Attorney General I have a responsibility to enforce the laws of this Nation, to protect this country from its enemies, and to ensure the fair administration of justice"
"1593","sessions"," I intend to work every day with our fine team and the superb professionals in the Department of Justice to advance the important work we have to do"
"1594","sessions"," These false attacks, the innuendo, and the leaks, you can be sure, will not intimidate me"
"1595","sessions"," In fact, these events have only strengthened my resolve to fulfill my duty to reduce crime, and to support our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who work our streets every day"
"1596","sessions"," Just last week, it was reported that overdose deaths in this country are rising faster than ever recorded"
"1597","sessions"," The murder rate is up over 10 percent�the largest increase since 1968"
"1598","sessions"," Together, we are telling the gangs, the cartels, the fraudsters, and the terrorists�we are coming after you"
"1599","sessions"," Every one of our citizens, no matter who they are or where they live, has the right to be safe in their homes and communities"
"1600","sessions"," And I will not be deterred, and I will not allow this great Department to be deterred from its vital mission"
"1601","mulvaney","Thank you, Chairman Enzi, Ranking Member Sanders, and members of the Committee for welcoming me today"
"1602","mulvaney"," It is an honor and a privilege to be here"
"1603","mulvaney"," I am pleased to present my qualifications and my vision for the Office of Management and Budget to this committee"
"1604","mulvaney"," Thank you to the President for nominating me, and for the confidence he showed in me by doing so"
"1605","mulvaney"," Thank you to Senator Graham and Senator Cotton for your kind remarks"
"1606","mulvaney"," Thank you especially to my family"
"1607","mulvaney"," As the members of this committee know better than most, the burdens of public service often fall on our families"
"1608","mulvaney"," I deeply appreciate their continued support"
"1609","mulvaney"," We don�t get an opportunity to say this nearly enough, and almost never on national television, but I am very proud of the young adults my children have become, despite the fact � or maybe because of the fact? � that their dad has been away from home for much of the past several years"
"1610","mulvaney"," And that is a testament to the kind of woman my wife is"
"1611","mulvaney"," I am extraordinarily proud, and happy, to have her in my life"
"1612","mulvaney"," Finally, I am grateful for the members of the Committee and their staff, not only for having me here today, but also for taking the time to meet with me over the last few weeks and sharing your views"
"1613","mulvaney"," Should I be confirmed, I look forward to continuing our conversations, and to getting your guidance and wisdom"
"1614","mulvaney"," Because no one can do this job alone"
"1615","mulvaney"," Perhaps a member of Congress knows that better than most"
"1616","mulvaney"," Several former members of Congress have served at OMB � Senator Portman, Jim Nussle, Leon Panetta � they all served with distinction, set a high bar, and provided a good example of how the OMB director should interact with and serve the President, Congress, and the American people"
"1617","mulvaney"," If confirmed, I will use them as models"
"1618","mulvaney"," You deserve the truth, as do the American people, and it is the OMB Director�s responsibility to tell you � and the President � the truth, even when that might be hard to hear"
"1619","mulvaney"," For the first time in America�s history, the next generation could be less prosperous than the generation that preceded it"
"1620","mulvaney"," To me, and to the people in this room, that is simply unacceptable"
"1621","mulvaney"," We CAN turn this economy, and this country around�but it will take tough decisions today in order to avoid impossible ones tomorrow"
"1622","mulvaney"," Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion"
"1623","mulvaney"," That number is so large as to defy description"
"1624","mulvaney"," I choose to look at it another way: to an ordinary American family, that translates to a credit card bill of $260,000"
"1625","mulvaney"," Families know what that would mean for them"
"1626","mulvaney"," It is time for government to learn the same lesson"
"1627","mulvaney"," I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later"
"1628","mulvaney"," I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy"
"1629","mulvaney"," This must include changing our government�s long-term fiscal path � which is unsustainable"
"1630","mulvaney"," Part of fixing that problem also means taking a hard look at government waste�and then ending it"
"1631","mulvaney"," American taxpayers deserve a government that is efficient, effective, and accountable"
"1632","mulvaney"," American families earn their money honestly; they expect the government to spend it honestly"
"1633","mulvaney"," We owe them that much"
"1634","mulvaney"," But fixing the economy doesn�t mean just taking a green eyeshade approach to the budget"
"1635","mulvaney"," Our government isn�t just about numbers"
"1636","mulvaney"," A strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable"
"1637","mulvaney"," My mother-in-law relied on social security when she retired; she relied on Medicare to see to her medical needs before she died of cancer"
"1638","mulvaney"," Pam and I were glad that the safety net was there for her"
"1639","mulvaney"," We would also like it to be there for her grandchildren, our triplets, as well"
"1640","mulvaney"," All of that being said, I know many of the members of this committee will want to know what my positions will be as OMB Director"
"1641","mulvaney"," I am, of course, not yet in that position, and I do not presume to know about decisions I might make, much less what decisions the President might make after consulting his cabinet and advisors"
"1642","mulvaney"," I do know what I believe, however, and I look forward to discussing whatever topics you consider relevant today"
"1643","mulvaney"," I recognize that good public service � whether in a state legislature, Congress, or OMB � takes both courage and wisdom"
"1644","mulvaney"," The courage to lead, and the wisdom to listen"
"1645","mulvaney"," I have learned that I do not have a monopoly on good ideas"
"1646","mulvaney"," Facts � and the cogent arguments of others � matter"
"1647","mulvaney"," I will be loyal to the facts, and to the American people whom I serve"
"1648","mulvaney"," My commitment to you today is to take a fact-based approach to get our financial house in order"
"1649","mulvaney"," OMB also fulfills significant management responsibilities, and plays a significant role in dealing with the regulatory environment � among several other important functions, as you all know"
"1650","mulvaney"," I look forward to talking about any and all of those issues, as this committee sees fit"
"1651","mulvaney"," And if confirmed, I look forward to working with Congress � and serving the President � to address these challenges on behalf of the people we all serve"
"1652","letter","President Trump is facing a test to his presidency unlike any faced by a modern American leader"
"1653","letter","  It�s not just that the special counsel looms large"
"1654","letter"," Or that the country is bitterly divided over Mr"
"1655","letter"," Trump�s leadership"
"1656","letter"," Or even that his party might well lose the House to an opposition hellbent on his downfall"
"1657","letter","  The dilemma � which he does not fully grasp � is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations"
"1658","letter","  I would know"
"1659","letter"," I am one of them"
"1660","letter","  To be clear, ours is not the popular �resistance� of the left"
"1661","letter"," We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous"
"1662","letter","  But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic"
"1663","letter"," That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr"
"1664","letter"," Trump�s more misguided impulses until he is out of office"
"1665","letter","  The root of the problem is the president�s amorality"
"1666","letter"," Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making"
"1667","letter","  Although he was elected as a Republican, the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives: free minds, free markets and free people"
"1668","letter"," At best, he has invoked these ideals in scripted settings"
"1669","letter"," At worst, he has attacked them outright"
"1670","letter","  In addition to his mass-marketing of the notion that the press is the �enemy of the people,� President Trump�s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic"
"1671","letter","  Don�t get me wrong"
"1672","letter"," There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more"
"1673","letter","  But these successes have come despite � not because of � the president�s leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective"
"1674","letter","  From the White House to executive branch departments and agencies, senior officials will privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander in chief�s comments and actions"
"1675","letter"," Most are working to insulate their operations from his whims"
"1676","letter","  Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back"
"1677","letter","  �There is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next,� a top official complained to me recently, exasperated by an Oval Office meeting at which the president flip-flopped on a major policy decision he�d made only a week earlier"
"1678","letter"," The erratic behavior would be more concerning if it weren�t for unsung heroes in and around the White House"
"1679","letter"," Some of his aides have been cast as villains by the media"
"1680","letter"," But in private, they have gone to great lengths to keep bad decisions contained to the West Wing, though they are clearly not always successful"
"1681","letter","  It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room"
"1682","letter"," We fully recognize what is happening"
"1683","letter"," And we are trying to do what�s right even when Donald Trump won�t"
"1684","letter","  The result is a two-track presidency"
"1685","letter","  Take foreign policy: In public and in private, President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea�s leader, Kim Jong-un, and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied, like-minded nations"
"1686","letter","  Astute observers have noted, though, that the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly, and where allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals"
"1687","letter","  On Russia, for instance, the president was reluctant to expel so many of Mr"
"1688","letter"," Putin�s spies as punishment for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain"
"1689","letter"," He complained for weeks about senior staff members letting him get boxed into further confrontation with Russia, and he expressed frustration that the United States continued to impose sanctions on the country for its malign behavior"
"1690","letter"," But his national security team knew better � such actions had to be taken, to hold Moscow accountable"
